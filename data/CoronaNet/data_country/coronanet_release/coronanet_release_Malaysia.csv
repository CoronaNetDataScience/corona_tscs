He said all government and private premises would be closed during the movement control order, except for essential services such as utilities, telecommunications, transport, banking, health, pharmacies, ports, airports, cleaning and food supplies.

He said that the movement control order also means all Malaysians will be banned from travelling abroad, and that no tourists or foreigners will be allowed to enter the country.
