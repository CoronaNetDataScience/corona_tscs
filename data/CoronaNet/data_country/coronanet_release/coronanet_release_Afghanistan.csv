The strategy had been recommended by the ICSARC and approved by the cabinet. It would go into effect in all provincial and central government institutions apart from the Ministry of Public Health (MoPH).

Main points of strategy

According to the strategy working hours in government institutions would begin from 8:00am and end at 1:00pm without any break.

Government institutions and department that direly need employees could make arrangement by introducing morning and afternoon shifts.

The strategy, however, said that employees who are focal points and their signature is needed should be present to make sure that work moves smoothly.

Government institutions had been asked to avoid gathering of more people and ensure at least one metre distance among employees in offices.

The government institutions had been advised to conduct their meetings conferences through video, voice calls and other available resources.
