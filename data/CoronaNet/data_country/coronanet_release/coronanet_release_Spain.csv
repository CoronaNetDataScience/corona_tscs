1. The teaching that is collected in this point, may be taught with the limitation of 75% of its capacity.
2. In the configuration of the musical or choir performance area, the minimum separation will be 1.5 meters between any of its members, as well as between performers and other people.  If this distance cannot be guaranteed, masks must be used, so in the wind, brass, and other instruments with mouthpieces, distance will be a priority and limiting factor in use.
3. In the same way, the dance activity must contemplate, as far as possible, the separation of 1.5 meters. If this distance cannot be guaranteed, masks must be used.
4. Personal furniture (chairs, attics) must be cleaned and disinfected before and after use.
5. In instruments that are usually shared (percussion, pianos and others), their use must be programmed to proceed with meticulous cleaning, before and after each change of musical performer. In the case of dance, the shared spaces for performance (floor and handrails, among others) must also be meticulously cleaned before and after each change of performer.

As the de-escalation will take place ""at a different, yet coordinated, rate"" in each province, the severity of curfew restrictions per province largely depends on that particular environment, meaning the beginning of this plan therefore replaces the national curfew restrictions preceding it. (Additionally, due to the province-centric characteristic of the de-escalation measure, all advancements in the plan will be coded sub-nationally for each individual province.)

 UPDATE: On June 21, the national state of alarm is lifted therefore ending the de-escalation plan.
