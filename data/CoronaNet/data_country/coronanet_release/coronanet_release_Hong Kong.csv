R_Wul6XqDkZYMvcuRNA,9383517,new_entry,,,"","The Hong Kong government has imposed its first Covid-19 lockdown in densely populated Jordan for 48 hours. Around 10,000 residents will be affected from Saturday.

The Hong Kong government officially confirmed at 4am on Saturday that the restricted area in Yau Tsim Mong district bordered by Woosung Street, Nanking Street, Battery Street and Kansu Street would be effectively locked down for 48 hours.

Starting on Saturday morning, residents living in some 200 buildings in the cordon will not be allowed to leave the area until the restriction is lifted.

Under the amendment to the Prevention and Control of Disease (Compulsory Testing for Certain Persons) Regulation (Cap. 599J), those breaking lockdown orders face a maximum penalty of six months in prison and HK$25,000 (US$3,225) in fines.

Only three types of people are allowed to enter the area: residents, relatives staying in the same flat as those in need of care, and staff members in urgently needed sectors such as elderly care.
