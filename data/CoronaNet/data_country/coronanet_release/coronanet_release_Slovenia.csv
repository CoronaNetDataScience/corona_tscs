As of 25 May, 2020, pupils in their final year of primary education in Slovenia returned to their schools, which means that nearly half of the primary and secondary school population is back in the classroom, the rest continuing learning at home. Out of 87,000 children enrolled in kindergartens in the 2019/2020 school year, 56% returned to their kindergartens a week ago. However, 38,000 children are still being looked after by their parents or grandparents.
