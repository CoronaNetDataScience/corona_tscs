On the 21 April 2020, the National Cabinet agreed that from 27 April 2020, category 2 and some important category 3 procedures can recommence across the public and private hospital sectors. These include IVF; screening programs (cancer and other diseases); post cancer reconstruction procedures (such as breast reconstruction); procedures for children under 18 years of age; joint replacements (including knees, hips, shoulders); cataracts and eye procedures; and endoscopy and colonoscopy procedures.

On 15 May 2020, the Australian National Cabinet announced that it is considered safe to reopen elective surgery activity in an incremental and cautious way, while maintaining necessary ICU capacity for any localised outbreaks of COVID-19. The reopening will involve 3 stages.

Stage 1 – up to 50 per cent of normal surgical activity levels (including reportable and non-reportable);
Stage 2 – up to 75 per cent of normal surgical activity levels (including reportable and non-reportable);
Stage 3 – up to 100 per cent of normal surgical activity levels (including reportable and non-reportable) or as close to normal activity levels as is safely possible. UPDATE: On the 25 March 2020, all non urgent elective surgery was suspended. The original policy was relaxed on 27 April 2020 and certain procedures recommenced.

Availability of hand hygiene products and suitable waste receptacles, with frequent cleaning and waste disposal.
