On the 21 April 2020, the National Cabinet agreed that from 27 April 2020, category 2 and some important category 3 procedures can recommence across the public and private hospital sectors. These include IVF; screening programs (cancer and other diseases); post cancer reconstruction procedures (such as breast reconstruction); procedures for children under 18 years of age; joint replacements (including knees, hips, shoulders); cataracts and eye procedures; and endoscopy and colonoscopy procedures.

On 15 May 2020, the Australian National Cabinet announced that it is considered safe to reopen elective surgery activity in an incremental and cautious way, while maintaining necessary ICU capacity for any localised outbreaks of COVID-19. The reopening will involve 3 stages.

Stage 1 – up to 50 per cent of normal surgical activity levels (including reportable and non-reportable);
Stage 2 – up to 75 per cent of normal surgical activity levels (including reportable and non-reportable);
Stage 3 – up to 100 per cent of normal surgical activity levels (including reportable and non-reportable) or as close to normal activity levels as is safely possible. UPDATE: On the 25 March 2020, all non urgent elective surgery was suspended. The original policy was relaxed on 27 April 2020 and certain procedures recommenced.

R_NWkoTbm1VT2RcopGc,126930Gc,new_entry,,,"","24/11/2020: From 30 November, businesses and organisations must review their COVID-19 Safety Plans every six months. They must also appoint a COVID Safety Supervisor from their team to implement their plan and collect customer contact details  to assist with contact tracing.

The new COVID-Safe Check-In system requires businesses, organisations and venues to collect customer contact details. The Northern Territory Government has launched a new app (The Territory Check In) to make it easier to collect customer contact details.

The Territory Check In app is not a compulsory platform; venues that already record the required visitor information do not need to implement a new system or change their current system. The app is a free and convenient option for venues who have not set up their own COVID-safe check-in system.

Business and venues that must collect customer contact details include:
- Businesses selling food and beverages on premises – like cafes, restaurants, pubs and bars.
- Cinemas and other entertainment and amusement venues.
- Casinos and TABs.
- Hairdressers, barbers, and other beauty therapy services – like nail salon and tattoo parlours.
- Tourism operators – like bus or boat tour operators.
- Swimming pools, gyms, indoor sporting facilities, and health and wellness centres – such as pilates studios.
- Places of religious worship.

In a given occupied space, there must be no more than one person per four square metres of ground space and; 
Availability of hand hygiene products and suitable waste receptacles, with frequent cleaning and waste disposal.

Food markets are exempt from the 500 person limit, however must undertake additional measures, such as control of patronage level numbers or stall density reduction to decrease the risk of COVID-19 transmission.

There may be other gatherings that are considered essential and it is at the discretion of the individual state and territory Chief Medical Officers or equivalent to assess each on their merits, and determine whether they can continue if mitigated by social distancing measures.

Visitors and staff who have returned from overseas in the last 14 days; been in contact with a confirmed case of COVID-19 in the last 14 days; with fever or symptoms of acute respiratory infection (e.g. cough, sore throat, runny nose, shortness of breath); and who have not been vaccinated against influenza (after 1 May) are restricted from entering the facilities. 

Furthermore, visits should be limited to a short duration; a maximum of two immediate social supports (family members, close friends) or professional service or advocacy at one time, per day; be conducted in a resident’s room, outdoors, or in a specific area designated by the aged care facility, rather than communal areas where the risk of transmission to residents is greater. There must be no large group visits or gatherings, including social activities or entertainment, should be permitted at this time; and no school groups of any size should be allowed to visit aged care facilities.

Visitors should also be encouraged to practise social distancing practices where possible, including maintaining a distance of 1.5 metres. Children aged 16 years or less must be permitted only by exception, as they are generally unable to comply with hygiene measures. Exemptions can be assessed on a case-by-case basis, for example, where the resident is in a palliative care scenario. Measures such as phone or video calls must be accessible to all residents to enable more regular communication with family members.

This document was published alongside the Australian Institute of Sport (AIS) “Framework for Rebooting Sport in a COVID-19 environment” that outlines how sports activities will be reintroduced at all levels. 

Community and Individual sporting activities have been categorised into three categories. Level A activities are those that can be conducted by a solo athlete or by pairs where at least 1.5m can always be maintained between participants. Level B activities are both indoor/outdoor activities that can be conducted in small groups (not more than 10 athletes and/or other personnel in total) and with adequate spacing (not more than
1 person per 4m2). Level C activities are those that can be conducted in groups of any size including full contact (competition, tournaments,
matches). Wrestling, holding, tackling and/or binding (e.g. rugby scrums) permitted.

This document was published alongside the Australian Institute of Sport (AIS) “Framework for Rebooting Sport in a COVID-19 environment” that outlines how sports activities will be reintroduced at all levels. 

Community and Individual sporting activities have been categorised into three categories. Level A activities are those that can be conducted by a solo athlete or by pairs where at least 1.5m can always be maintained between participants. Level B activities are both indoor/outdoor activities that can be conducted in small groups (not more than 10 athletes and/or other personnel in total) and with adequate spacing (not more than
1 person per 4m2). Level C activities are those that can be conducted in groups of any size including full contact (competition, tournaments,
