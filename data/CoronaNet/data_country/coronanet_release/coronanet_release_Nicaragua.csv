They exclude from the total of positive cases, patients who died or recovered from the virus.Experts in Nicaragua agree the government uses confusing arithmetic for propaganda purposes and to reinforce the idea that the health system has controlled the pandemic. The reduction of figures is not limited only to positive cases. Statistics are also applied to suspicious cases, so data is also always on the downside.Other experts added that in the absence of massive tests, Nicaragua suffers from “epidemiological blindness,” which could be serious in following the trail and curve of contagion of the virus.To date, the Ministry of Health has not revealed how many tests have been carried out in total. Due to pressure from independent experts for a larger sampling, Dr. Carlos Saenz was forced to give an answer.
