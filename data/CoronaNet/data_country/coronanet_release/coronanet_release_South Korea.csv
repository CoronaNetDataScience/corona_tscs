Excess blame can cause patients to suffer the aftermath of psychological trauma even after recovering from the infection. Such a culture can potentially result in people refusing to be tested for the fear of social stigma, causing in turn more infection to spread to local communities. The transparent, timely disclosure of infection-related information is provided for the purpose of infection prevention only, as it helps to find potential cases unable to be traced by epidemiological investigation by informing those who may have been exposed to the virus.
