Recommended that workplaces improve their on-site environment to enable distancing measures, periodically ventilate and disinfect their facilities, and adopt remote working environments for employees. Stressed continued adherence to social distancing measures to prevent transmission to high-risk groups. Expressed concern that the virus may be contracted by healthy adults and children via workplaces and schools and transmitted to the vulnerable groups such as the elderly and people with underlying illnesses via healthcare facilities, social welfare centers, religious gatherings, or other community spaces and events. Strongly advised that the elderly stay at home as much as possible and refrain from visiting places visited by a large number of people.

KCDC reminded everyone that COVID-19 is an infectious disease that can affect anyone and that infection shouldn’t be grounds for blame or social stigma. The KCDC asked citizens to send warm regards and encouragement to those who are affected by the virus, including confirmed patients and their families, people under self-quarantine, and recovered patients. Excess blame can cause patients to suffer the aftermath of psychological trauma even after recovering from the infection. Such a culture can potentially result in people refusing to be tested for the fear of social stigma, causing in turn more infection to spread to local communities. The transparent, timely disclosure of infection-related information is provided for the purpose of infection prevention only, as it helps to find potential cases unable to be traced by epidemiological investigation by informing those who may have been exposed to the virus.
