Movement across any Alert Level 3 boundary would be strictly limited to manage the risk of the virus spreading. Permissions to travel across any Alert Level 3 boundary fall into three categories:
Category 1 – movement that would be permitted under all circumstances, e.g. border services and emergency services
Category 2 – movement likely to be permitted, but for which an assessment would be required, e.g. primary industries

The Ministry of Health and MBIE have developed an online registration system that could be activated for both businesses and services, and personal, movement across an Alert Level boundary.

The system would enable businesses and services to register before any Alert Level increase came into effect, and automatically generate standardised, verifiable documentation to support Police enforcement and facilitate efficient movement through checkpoints.
The system is ready to be activated in the event of an Alert Level 3 boundary, at which time more information will be published on the website of the approval agency:
