It is another one-month extension to the current policy, issued in mid-May and extended twice since, to support foreigners stuck in the country due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The move means from now until September 30, people who came to Viet Nam under visa waiver programs, e-visas or tourism visas from March 1 can stay or leave Viet Nam without doing any paperwork or paying any fees.

Regulations on those who entered the country before March 1 remain the same as the current policy. They can be considered for this permit extension as long as they can prove they are stranded in Viet Nam due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
 
They need to provide certificates issued by their diplomatic mission in Viet Nam through an official diplomatic note with a translation in Vietnamese or documents issued by Vietnamese authorities to confirm they were quarantined or treated for COVID-19, among other reasons beyond their control.
