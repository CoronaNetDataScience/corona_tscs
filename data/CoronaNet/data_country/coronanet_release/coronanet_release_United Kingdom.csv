And to ensure you are safe at work we have been working to establish new guidance for employers to make workplaces COVID-secure. And when you do go to work, if possible do so by car or even better by walking or bicycle. But just as with workplaces, public transport operators will also be following COVID-secure standards"". Regarding outdoor exercise and leisure, he said ""And from this Wednesday, we want to encourage people to take more and even unlimited amounts of outdoor exercise.
