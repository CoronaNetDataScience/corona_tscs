Health Minister Kostadin Angelov said that these were people at high risk of infection, who in turn could transmit it.
In the first phase, 243 600 people will be vaccinated, according to Health Ministry estimates. The figure includes 30 000 physicians, 10 000 dentists, 46 000 other health care professionals, 6600 master pharmacists, 2000 assistant pharmacists and 150 000 support staff. In the second phase, vaccines will be given to staff and users of social institutions, educators and staff of mink farms. In the third phase, those to be vaccinated include employees of key state activities, such as water supply. The figure involved will be determined once regional health inspectorates have compiled lists. In the fourth phase, vaccines will be given to people over the age of 65 and people with concomitant diseases. This is estimated to involve about 1.8 million people. In the fifth phase, vaccines will be given to sections of the population vulnerable because of the high epidemiological risk of infection associated with their lifestyle.
