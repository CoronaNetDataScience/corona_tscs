Therefore, people in high risk groups must systematically implement all measures for   preventing the transmission and spread of the novel coronavirus. If you belong to a high-risk   group, you should do the following:  ? Avoid contact with persons who show signs and symptoms of a respiratory infection.  ? Avoid all unnecessary travels, particularly to areas or countries with confirmed virus   spread in the community.  ? Implement hand hygiene and avoid touching your own face with your hands (eyes,   nose, mouth)  ? Adhere to chronic medication regimen (if available) and to your doctors’ advice.  ?
