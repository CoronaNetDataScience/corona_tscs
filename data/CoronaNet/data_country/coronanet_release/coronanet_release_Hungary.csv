The National Government declares that this year's school-leaving exams will be held under changed conditions and with several precautions. Between May 4 and 21, only written exams will be organised. The exams in the major subjects will start at 9 instead of 8 am in order to avoid that students travel at the same time as those leaving for work. There will be a maximum of ten students per classroom and a distance of at least 1,5 metres will be maintained. There will be compulsory disinfection in all buildings and, if required but not compulsory, students and teachers will be provided with masks. If necessary, any classroom of any public education institution will be used as a venue for examinations.
Furthermore, only five subjects will be subject to oral examinations: Cultural studies, biblical studies, Judaism, folk art and religious studies. Sports will have oral examinations only. Because of the current restrictions on mass gatherings, graduation ceremonies cannot be held.

The National Government classifies countries into different categories. Hungarian citizens and family members of Hungarian citizens who are not Hungarian citizens entering Hungary from a green country may enter Hungary without any restrictions. The same individuals entering Hungary from a red or yellow country shall be subject to a medical examination upon arrival. Non-Hungarian citizens arriving from a green country may enter Hungary without any restrictions. Non-Hungarian citizens arriving from a yellow country shall be subject to a medical examination upon arrival. If the health examination reveals a suspicion of infection, individuals shall not be allowed to enter the territory of Hungary. Depending on the result of the medical examination, individuals may be placed in quarantine for 14 days. They need not be quarantined if submitting a negative PCR test result prior to entry. Non-Hungarian citizens arriving from a red country may not enter Hungary.
The list of countries classified as green, yellow or red can be found in the document ""Közlemény a COVID-19..."".
Various exceptions to these provisions exist. Those who may be exempted for reasons such as attendance at family events have to undergo an application procedure where they can prove their purpose of entry.

Tests are to be conducted by one of the seven designated, accredited laboratories for direct detection of the virus. The testing of the patients in the hospitals is done in a pre-examination room in the triage area.
