Effective June 27, EU and Schengen countries will be categorized as either open/yellow (åbent) or quarantine country/orange (karantæneland) depending on its level of coronavirus spread. 
To be categorized as yellow, the country needs to report a level of under 20 infected citizens/ 100 000 citizens. 
An orange is those that report a level of 30 infected citizens /100 000 citizens or higher, and for travelers entering Denmark from a quarantine country, the Danish authorities strongly encourage a self-isolation period of 14 days. 
The list of orange countries will be updated on a weekly basis as of June 27 2020. UPDATE: As of December 12 2020, Danish authorities will provide travelers with more detailed travel restrictions/recommendations as regions inside an orange/yellow country can be classified as low vs high risk, which in practice thus allows traveling to yellow regions in orange countries.
