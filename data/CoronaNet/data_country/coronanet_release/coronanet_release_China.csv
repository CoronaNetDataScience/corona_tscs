Social distancing must be observed in stations, ticket booths, scenic spots, rest areas, restaurants etc., to prevent gathering.

They must also arrange for tourists to enter at various periods. Places prone to congestion, such as the entrances and exits, scenic spots, narrow passages, etc., must be managed by staff. Routes must be optimised to avoid congestion. There should be additional staff for monitoring tourists at the scenic spots; uncivilised behaviours or those that do not meet epidemic prevention and control requirements must be addressed timely to maintain order.

Tourist attractions must strengthen the general public's knowledge of the epidemic to improve their awareness and cooperation with prevention and control measures.

Tourist attractions must set the limit of tourists, implement a ticket reservation system, and adopt scientific means to divert tourists effectively and control the tourist traffic. They must implement real-name registration and monitor tourist information regularly. Health screening must be carried out by implementing temperature checks and other methods. Social distancing must be observed in stations, ticket booths, scenic spots, rest areas, restaurants etc., to prevent gathering.

They must also arrange for tourists to enter at various periods. Places prone to congestion, such as the entrances and exits, scenic spots, narrow passages, etc., must be managed by staff. Routes must be optimised to avoid congestion. There should be additional staff for monitoring tourists at the scenic spots; uncivilised behaviours or those that do not meet epidemic prevention and control requirements must be addressed timely to maintain order.

Tourist attractions must strengthen the general public's knowledge of the epidemic to improve their awareness and cooperation with prevention and control measures. They should achieve this by releasing information regarding actions to be undertaken for re-opening and knowledge of epidemic prevention and control through, e.g., websites, WeChat public accounts, tourist service centres, signboards, broadcasts, and electronic displays.",2021-08-21,2021-08-21,2023-12-02,The policy has an unlimited time span (e.g. recommendation to wash one's hands; passing of a legal bill),China,CHN,CN,Provincial,1,Inner Mongolia,CN-NM,,Social Distancing,Keeping a distance of at least 6 feet or 1.5 meters apart at Tourist Sites,,"",,,,,,"","","","","","","","","","","",,,,,Yes,China,One or more provinces within one or more countries,,Inner Mongolia,,,,"",No special population targeted,,,Mandatory (Unspecified/Implied),"Provincial/State Government,Other (Please specify in the text box)",https://tummgmt.eu.qualtrics.com/Q/File.php?F=F_3imR0Ua0qwO2V4h,https://baijiahao.baidu.com/s?id=1708699091623892163&wfr=spider&for=pc,OxCGRT,OXCGRT_China_Inner Mongolia_20210821_events,2022-08-12,2022-08-12T05:57:48Z
