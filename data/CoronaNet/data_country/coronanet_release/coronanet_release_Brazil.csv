The results of the rapid tests, the active surveillance work with education professionals and the epidemiological situation of Covid-19 in Amazonas were presented, this Friday afternoon (08/21), by the president-director of FVS-AM, Rosemary da Costa Pinto, to representatives of the Public Prosecutor's Office (MPE) and Federal (MPF), the Public Prosecutor's Office (MPT) and the Public Defender's Office (DPE), in addition to the Union of Workers in Education (Sinteam).
