He added that it has an impact because the “vaccine protects people from contracting the virus and prevents severe conditions of the virus when one contracts it.”
 
“We have not done a study to say that the vaccinations are the result of the decline in positive cases but vaccines protect people against diseases and we believe it has contributed to the reduction of positive cases in the country,” he stated.

Mr. Njie noted that some people were reluctant at first to take the vaccine due to misconceptions but in their bid to avoid the vaccines from getting expired they expanded the priority groups and included those beyond 18 years in the vaccination campaign.
He added that convincing people to get vaccinated was a challenge but starting with President Adama Barrow influenced others to get vaccinated, saying “if the vaccine was going to kill, then the president would not still have been alive.”

The International Organization for Migration (IOM) has been working with the national health authorities to raise awareness among mobile populations along the country’s 749-kilometre border with its neighbour Senegal. The joint campaign includes complementary inoculation against the virus.

Madou received one of his COVID-19 shots through IOM’s and the Ministry of Health’s immunization campaign. “Living in a border community, I was scared when I heard about the coronavirus for the first time on the news,” says Madou. “The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a lot of confusion to the local population, but I know that it is a very serious disease, and the only thing we can do to prevent it is through medical advice and control. If we consult doctors, we can prevent ourselves and others from catching the virus.”

“The campaign is mainly targeting the border communities who are easily prone to being affected by the disease. Infected people can easily go to Senegal or come to The Gambia and spread the disease,” says Musa H. Camara who was trained to support the campaign in his community. “When COVID-19 struck, there were a lot of misconceptions around the virus’s effects on patients.

As the world tries to recover from the pandemic, the World Health Organisation (WHO) advised citizens of all countries to take the covid-19 vaccine in order to return to normalcy.

However, Gambians who took the Covid-19 jab before they travelled have disclosed how they were in contrast to those who were not vaccinated.

Pa Modou Cham, a journalist, who recently traveled to Nigeria, said getting vaccinated before traveling has eased challenges for him compared with people who did not take the vaccines.

According to him, one needs a Covid-19 vaccine certificate to fill the health survey before reaching his/her destination.


""Upon arrival at the airport, I was given an easy go because of my vaccination certificate. One of my colleagues who couldn't get his Covid-19 vaccination certificate was delayed at the airport and he was asked to pay $90 for the covid test before his release.""

Cham further noted that getting vaccinated before traveling is the best thing to do to ease certain obstacles and unnecessary charges that could be avoided.

During an interview with The Point Newspaper, she said: ""If you get vaccinated and then come into contact with the virus that causes the disease, your immune system will recognise it and be able to protect you by producing the right antibodies.""

Speaking at the start of the last nationwide Covid-19 vaccination campaign, she acknowledged that as a country, significant strides had been made as far as vaccination is concerned, yet there are rooms for improvement.
However, she spoke of her Ministry's unending resolve to ensure every Gambian is protected against Covid-19.
""We have this vision to vaccinate 70% of the population by December 31st 2022. And this cannot be achieved without conducting regular covid-19 vaccination.""
She thus called on people to get vaccinated as its advantages far outweigh its probable disadvantages.

The Gambia's Ministry of Health confirmed the country's first case of coronavirus on Tuesday, March 17, 2020.

However, as of 30th October 2022, The Gambia had officially registered 372 COVID-19-related deaths and 12,580 positive cases.

Speaking to The Point via telephone interview, Bubacarr Sidibeh, a regional youth chairperson for the Upper River Region (URR) - the country's farthest region - who took the COVID-19 vaccine since 2021, said he voluntarily took the jab to protect himself and people around him.


Mr. Sidibeh said as a youth leader, had he failed to take the vaccine, then all his close associates such as friends, co-workers and family members would have not been safe from the virus.

""I took the vaccine to protect myself from the disease and save others. I also take it to inspire the youth to take the jab because as a leader, taking the vaccine encourages others,"" he said.

Sidibeh advised young people to take the jab, describing it as safe.

With a current vaccination rate of 18% presenting a little over 625,000 people nationwide, the latest exercise, which is the ninth round, according to officials, would help in closing the gaps and surely meeting the nationwide target vaccination coverage of 70%.
However, since the start of the exercise, one word that remains a mantra is that Covid-19 is not going any time soon and people should vaccinate to minimise the rate of contracting or spreading the deadly virus.

Speaking to journalists on Thursday, Michael M. Mendy, acting director of Health Promotion and Education under the Directorate of Health Services at the Ministry of Health, said that was the ninth round of the mass covid-19 vaccination, adding that with the other round conducted earlier on, the country is still below reaching its target rate.

""One thing about the Ministry of Health is that we already have structures at community level that we can use, especially when we are to come up with campaigns like this,"" he said.
To this end, Sanyang also said they were able to use their structures at the community level such as Village Support Groups, traditional communicators and health teams as well as radios to amplify their message regarding Covid-19.
""We also have a health education promotion officer, who was also able to go to the radio likewise our health facilities to talk to the people especially women of child-bearing age, who come to the facilities prior to the campaign so that they help spread information about the exercise at the community level,"" he said.
He reiterated the safety and effectiveness of the Covid-19 vaccines, saying as citizens of this country ""if these vaccines"" are not safe, no one would allow it into the country.

UPDATE ON PRISONER PARDON BY PRESIDENT BARROW

The number of prisoners pardoned by H.E. President Adama Barrow increased to 121 from 115

 
As part of measures to curb COVID-19 and decongest prisons, His Excellency President Adama Barrow, in exercise of his Prerogative of Mercy, has immediately pardoned some prisoners.

Seventy eight (78) of those inmates are from the Mile 2 Central Prison in Banjul, twenty four (24) from Jeshwang prison within the Kanifing Municipality and thirteen (13) from Janjangbureh Prison in the Central River Region (CRR).


Ever since his coming to power in January 2017, President Barrow has consistently granted amnesty to prisoners. Soon after assuming office Barrow in a magnanimous gesture emptied Mile Prisons of all political detainees and prisoners some of whom were languishing behind the prison walls for decades without court appearance.

In the same spirit of caring for Gambians at home and abroad as well as non-Gambians resident in the country, President Barrow will unveil more COVID-19 relief programmes for citizens of The Gambia this weekend onwards.
