Under the slogan """"Con vos podemos"""", the official campaign was launched to receive financial donations in order to bring humanitarian aid to vulnerable people and families affected by the emergency caused by Covid-19.

The campaign -which will last until April 30- is promoted by the Government of the Republic together with the Costa Rican Banking Association (ABC), the Federation of Savings and Credit Cooperatives (FEDEAC) and kölbi.

This campaign is a public-private alliance so that people can make their financial donation, which will be translated into basic supplies such as food and hygiene kits for vulnerable families.

The inputs will be purchased from national farmers, enterprises and businesses in each community, which will in turn allow the local economy to be reactivated.

The distribution will be in charge of the Municipal Emergency Committees and food will arrive at the beneficiaries' house to avoid crowds.
