When a patient is tested, the doctor performing the test will ask the patient to record their contacts over the last few days.

From the middle of this week, patients infected with Covid-19 will be contacted by a call centre to ask who they have been in close contact with over the past few days. The form they filled out may be helpful during this call. People who have recently been in close contact with an infected person will also be called by the call centre. Their state of health will be assessed and, on that basis, they will be asked to take the necessary measures.

The infected patients’ general practitioner will already ask them whether they have been in close contact with certain people, such as people living in the same household. In this case, the general practitioner can issue a quarantine certificate for these people, even if the individuals concerned do not (yet) show symptoms and are fit for work. Individuals who have been issued with such a quarantine certificate must comply with the isolation measures. They can, however, work from home.

Under certain, strictly defined conditions this quarantine certificate may also be issued by the call centre under the responsibility of a hygiene inspector.",2020-05-04,2020-05-11,,The policy’s end date is unknown or unreported,Belgium,BEL,BE,National,0,,,,Health Monitoring,,,"",,,,,,"","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"",Yes,Belgium,"One or more countries, but not all countries",,,,,,,,,,Mandatory (Unspecified/Implied),"National Government,Ministry/Department of Health,Provincial/State Government",72.629688392336,69.1932738396756,66.0295914210194,80,https://tummgmt.eu.qualtrics.com/Q/File.php?F=F_V4qqhP0nRlTVgPf,https://www.info-coronavirus.be/en/news/inter-ministerial-conference-on-public-health/ ; https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/nl/2020/05/06/opgelet-contactopsporing-bij-coronabesmetting-gebeurt-alleen-me/,2021-03-01,2021-03-01T08:32:15Z

For those for whom this organization is not possible, social distancing will be strictly respected. This rule applies to both the performance of the work and the transport organized by the employer. If it is impossible for companies to meet these obligations, they must close their doors.

Companies - regardless of size - are obliged to organize teleworking for every function where this is possible, without exception.
For those for whom this organization is not possible, social distancing will be strictly respected. This rule applies to both the performance of the work and the transport organized by the employer. If it is impossible for companies to meet these obligations, they must close their doors.
If the authorities establish that the social distancing measures are not being complied with, the company will in the first instance be fined a heavy one; in case of non-compliance after the sanction, the company will have to close.

The measures set out below will enter into force at noon on Wednesday 18 March and shall be maintained until 5 April. The situation will continue to be assessed on a daily basis and further changes may be made as the situation evolves.
