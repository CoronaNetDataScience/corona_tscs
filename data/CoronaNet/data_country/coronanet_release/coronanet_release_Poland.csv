""- The elderly, over 70 years of age, are primarily exposed to a serious threat to health and life. That is why we are introducing the ""Support the Senior"" program. We are asking seniors not to leave the house and not to move around, said Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki.

Solidarity Corps for Supporting Seniors

The just announced program is coordinated by the Ministry of Family and Social Policy. Thanks to it, helping seniors during the coronavirus pandemic and actions taken in this area by the government, local governments and social welfare centers will run more efficiently. The elderly will receive the necessary help in a difficult time from volunteers, non-governmental organizations, scouts, and volunteer fire brigades and the Territorial Defense Forces.

Special helpline for seniors - 22 505 11 11

As part of the Corps, we have launched a special hotline for seniors over 70 years of age. Through it, the elderly will be able to ask for help in activities that require leaving home, and which are hindered by the pandemic.

Senior, are you over 70 and need support?

    Call the hotline on 22 505 11 11 .
    The helpline person will forward your number to a social welfare center in your municipality.
    Wait for the call of the resort employee, who will contact you and arrange all the details.
    The volunteer will provide you with the products or medications you have requested.

What is Coronavirus?

The new SARS-Cov-2 coronavirus causes a disease called COVID-19. The disease is most often manifested by fever, cough, shortness of breath, muscle aches and fatigue.
How common are symptoms?

The severe course of the disease is observed in about 15-20% of people. Deaths occur in 2-3% of sick people. Probably these data are overestimated, because in many people with a mild course of the infection, laboratory confirmation has not been made.
Who is most at risk?

The most vulnerable to severe disease and death are elderly, immunocompromised people accompanied by other diseases, especially chronic ones.
How to protect yourself against the coronavirus?

The virus is spread by airborne droplets. There is currently no vaccine against the new coronavirus. However, other methods of preventing infection, as outlined below, can be used. These methods are also used in the prevention of other diseases transmitted by airborne droplets, such as seasonal flu (where the peak incidence is between January and March each year).
Where have coronavirus infections been reported so far?

The highest number of confirmed cases of infection with the new coronavirus was registered in China (99%), mainly in Hubei province. The remaining people ""dragged"" the virus to other countries in Asia, Europe, Oceania and North America and infected other people (eg in Germany, France, Great Britain).""",2020-02-28,2020-02-28,2023-06-29,The policy has an unlimited time span (e.g. recommendation to wash one's hands; passing of a legal bill),Poland,POL,PL,National,1,,,,Public Awareness Measures,Disseminating information related to COVID-19 to the public that is reliable and factually accurate,,"",,,,,,"","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"",Yes,Poland,"One or more countries, but not all countries",,,,,,All Residents (Citizen Residents + Foreign Residents),No special population targeted,,,Voluntary/Recommended but No Penalties,National Government,https://tummgmt.eu.qualtrics.com/Q/File.php?F=F_09zhdCqulhQoNgZ,http://web.archive.org/web/20200313025749/https://www.gov.pl/web/koronawirus/informacje,CoronaNet (original),,2022-04-12,2022-04-12T13:03:10Z

How to help? - Four simple steps:

    provide your bearing details - name and phone number
    print it and ...
    hang on your door, cage or on the nearest advertising pole.

To make access to vaccinations even easier, with the new school year, schools across the country are joining pharmacies, shopping malls and mass events. Remember that even the best school equipment with safety measures and following all established rules may not prevent your child from becoming infected. This is why school principals will organize vaccinations in their schools.

    organizing classes with an educator for students,
