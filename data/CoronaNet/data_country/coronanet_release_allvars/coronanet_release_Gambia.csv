R_p3Ph2Ot34QfwMApNA,2709043,new_entry,,,"","However, Mbye Njie, the deputy programme manager for the Expanded Programme on Immunization at the Ministry of Health, said the decline in the number of positive Covid-19 cases might not be directly linked with the vaccination. He added that it has an impact because the “vaccine protects people from contracting the virus and prevents severe conditions of the virus when one contracts it.”
 
“We have not done a study to say that the vaccinations are the result of the decline in positive cases but vaccines protect people against diseases and we believe it has contributed to the reduction of positive cases in the country,” he stated.

Mr. Njie noted that some people were reluctant at first to take the vaccine due to misconceptions but in their bid to avoid the vaccines from getting expired they expanded the priority groups and included those beyond 18 years in the vaccination campaign.
He added that convincing people to get vaccinated was a challenge but starting with President Adama Barrow influenced others to get vaccinated, saying “if the vaccine was going to kill, then the president would not still have been alive.”

As the world tries to recover from the pandemic, the World Health Organisation (WHO) advised citizens of all countries to take the covid-19 vaccine in order to return to normalcy.

However, Gambians who took the Covid-19 jab before they travelled have disclosed how they were in contrast to those who were not vaccinated.

Pa Modou Cham, a journalist, who recently traveled to Nigeria, said getting vaccinated before traveling has eased challenges for him compared with people who did not take the vaccines.

According to him, one needs a Covid-19 vaccine certificate to fill the health survey before reaching his/her destination.


""Upon arrival at the airport, I was given an easy go because of my vaccination certificate. One of my colleagues who couldn't get his Covid-19 vaccination certificate was delayed at the airport and he was asked to pay $90 for the covid test before his release.""

Cham further noted that getting vaccinated before traveling is the best thing to do to ease certain obstacles and unnecessary charges that could be avoided.

According to him, his ministry has always advocated that we view the pandemic from the lens. ""This is why our outreach. We are optimistic that the awareness campaign will reach more communities and encourage more people to take the vaccine.""

According to him, 354,340 (Three hundred and fifty four thousand three hundred and forty) people have been fully vaccinated in the country.

During an interview with The Point Newspaper, she said: ""If you get vaccinated and then come into contact with the virus that causes the disease, your immune system will recognise it and be able to protect you by producing the right antibodies.""
Buba Jammeh, another vaccinated person, said he believes that all those vaccines were approved on the basis of large studies of safety and effectiveness.

Fatou Sarr, a native of Nema Alkali, who took the vaccine some time ago, said: ""Prior to being vaccinated I had to avoid coming in contact with people. I had to walk daily to and from the market. I had to also allow my husband to drop off our children to school and pick them up when they close.

Speaking at the start of the last nationwide Covid-19 vaccination campaign, she acknowledged that as a country, significant strides had been made as far as vaccination is concerned, yet there are rooms for improvement.
However, she spoke of her Ministry's unending resolve to ensure every Gambian is protected against Covid-19.
""We have this vision to vaccinate 70% of the population by December 31st 2022. And this cannot be achieved without conducting regular covid-19 vaccination.""
She thus called on people to get vaccinated as its advantages far outweigh its probable disadvantages.

The Gambia's Ministry of Health confirmed the country's first case of coronavirus on Tuesday, March 17, 2020.

However, as of 30th October 2022, The Gambia had officially registered 372 COVID-19-related deaths and 12,580 positive cases.

Speaking to The Point via telephone interview, Bubacarr Sidibeh, a regional youth chairperson for the Upper River Region (URR) - the country's farthest region - who took the COVID-19 vaccine since 2021, said he voluntarily took the jab to protect himself and people around him.


Mr. Sidibeh said as a youth leader, had he failed to take the vaccine, then all his close associates such as friends, co-workers and family members would have not been safe from the virus.

""I took the vaccine to protect myself from the disease and save others. I also take it to inspire the youth to take the jab because as a leader, taking the vaccine encourages others,"" he said.

Sidibeh advised young people to take the jab, describing it as safe.

UPDATE ON PRISONER PARDON BY PRESIDENT BARROW

The number of prisoners pardoned by H.E. President Adama Barrow increased to 121 from 115

 
As part of measures to curb COVID-19 and decongest prisons, His Excellency President Adama Barrow, in exercise of his Prerogative of Mercy, has immediately pardoned some prisoners.

Seventy eight (78) of those inmates are from the Mile 2 Central Prison in Banjul, twenty four (24) from Jeshwang prison within the Kanifing Municipality and thirteen (13) from Janjangbureh Prison in the Central River Region (CRR).


Ever since his coming to power in January 2017, President Barrow has consistently granted amnesty to prisoners. Soon after assuming office Barrow in a magnanimous gesture emptied Mile Prisons of all political detainees and prisoners some of whom were languishing behind the prison walls for decades without court appearance.

In the same spirit of caring for Gambians at home and abroad as well as non-Gambians resident in the country, President Barrow will unveil more COVID-19 relief programmes for citizens of The Gambia this weekend onwards.
