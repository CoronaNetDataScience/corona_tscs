Kindergartens will continue to operate on-site after April 7[2021]. To reduce the risk of Covid-19 spread, workers should adhere to epidemiological safety requirements, including the use of mouth and nose pads. Kindergarten staff will continue to be tested once a week.

At other levels of education, learning is provided remotely, but with a few exceptions, with education as one of the government's priorities and children's psycho-emotional health. From April 7, in municipalities where the two-week morbidity rate per 100,000 people does not exceed 200, face-to-face training can be organized for 1-6. and 12th grade students. 7.-11. For pupils in the classroom, full-time studies may take place on a rotating basis so that the classes do not overlap in the educational establishment. In order to resume full-time studies, the educational institution must provide epidemiological requirements and weekly testing of staff.

Individual face-to-face counseling will still be available throughout Latvia for 12th grade students and those at risk of dropping out, and for those who have to take state examinations in the first half of 2021. On-site consultations take place only at the individual invitation of the teacher in accordance with the epidemiological safety procedure. The consultation time should not exceed 40 minutes.

In municipalities where the number of new Covid-19 infections per 100,000 inhabitants exceeds 200 in two weeks, 12th grade students will be able to attend on-site training no more than two days a week in the subjects where the centralized examinations are taken.

Additionally 

However, Kindergartens may be fully operational subject to epidemiological safety requirements UPDATE: Whereas prior, classes for preschool could operate under certain circumstances and some schools could open when under the 250/100,000 threshold now...

Kindergartens will continue to operate on-site after April 7[2021]. To reduce the risk of Covid-19 spread, workers should adhere to epidemiological safety requirements, including the use of mouth and nose pads. Kindergarten staff will continue to be tested once a week.

At other levels of education, learning is provided remotely, but with a few exceptions, with education as one of the government's priorities and children's psycho-emotional health. From April 7, in municipalities where the two-week morbidity rate per 100,000 people does not exceed 200, face-to-face training can be organized for 1-6. and 12th grade students. 7.-11. For pupils in the classroom, full-time studies may take place on a rotating basis so that the classes do not overlap in the educational establishment. In order to resume full-time studies, the educational institution must provide epidemiological requirements and weekly testing of staff.

Individual face-to-face counseling will still be available throughout Latvia for 12th grade students and those at risk of dropping out, and for those who have to take state examinations in the first half of 2021. On-site consultations take place only at the individual invitation of the teacher in accordance with the epidemiological safety procedure. The consultation time should not exceed 40 minutes.

It is currently planned that a total of more than 800 000 people could be provided with a state-paid vaccine. This number could be higher if the vaccine manufacturers approve Latvia's order.

So far, the National Health Service has entered into an agreement on the supply of vaccines with two vaccine manufacturers — AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson (Janssen). The Minister for Health Ilze Viņķele said that €1.6 million has been paid upfront s so that Latvia can receive these vaccines.

It is likely that there will also be an agreement with another potential manufacturer, Pfizer, and altogether there are 7-8 producers in the ministry's lists.

“Latvia will do everything to make vaccines available,” the minister said.

The Ministry currently forecasts that, following a positive development scenario, the first delivery (according to the schedule for deliveries of “AstraZeneca”) is to take place in the first quarter of next year. The entire volume ordered will not be delivered immediately, but in parts every month.

The need to contract with several vaccine manufacturers is due to the fact that it is currently not possible to predict whether the registration process for all vaccines will be successful. It is also not possible to determine which vaccines will be the most effective, efficient and safe, and it is not known exactly which vaccines will be available the fastest.

If the European Medicines Agency (EMA) recommends that the vaccine developed by BioNTech and Pfizer be registered on Monday, 21 December, the European Commission (EC) will decide in a few days to grant a marketing authorization valid in all EU and EEA countries. After that, the vaccine can be delivered to all European Union countries at the same time, including Latvia. Thus, on December 28, 10 vaccination offices will start operating in Latvia, where medical staff working with COVID-19 patients and employees of the Emergency Medical Service (NMPD) will be able to receive the vaccine.

All of these dates are subject to change as neither the ESA nor the EC has officially confirmed these dates. Minister of Health Ilze Hänķele emphasizes: “Starting vaccination is not a race for speed. Our priority is to make sure that everyone involved is knowledgeable and ready to go. Let me remind you that there is some information that EU countries will only receive when the ESA recommends that a vaccine be registered. At the same time, we have made every effort to ensure that the Latvian side is ready to receive the vaccine, organize its distribution and offer it to the first group in society, which is currently the most vulnerable - doctors working with COVID-19 patients and NMPD staff. ”

This page was last updated on January 28, 2021

It is planned to vaccinate up to 70% of the Latvian population by the end of the summer, according to the informative report of the Ministry of Health ""On the Covid-19 vaccination plan"", which was heard today by the Cabinet of Ministers.

Minister of Health Daniels Pavļuts: “The vaccination plan we approved in government today is detailed, digital and flexible. Uncertainty is the only certainty of the time, now we will be ready to act in different situations. Both when there is a delay in the supply of vaccines and when there are a lot of them. ”

The updated vaccination plan is designed to make optimal use of the resources of the vaccination system and to implement a convenient and flexible vaccination process. The plan sets out a number of basic principles:

    the establishment of common lists of vaccinees, which will make it possible to maintain contact between those who have expressed an interest in vaccination and the location of the population in the priority group, as well as vaccination sites,
    the creation of a common calendar and queue to help plan the workload and opening hours of vaccination points and the management of records,
    centralized supply of vaccines and stockpile management,
    unified communication with the population.

The Ministry of Health invites all residents over the age of 70 who want to be vaccinated against Covid-19, but have not yet applied for their vaccine at www.manavakcina.lv or by calling 8989, to contact their family doctor now.

If the family doctor is also a provider of vaccination services (the family doctor will be able to tell you during the interview), then the family doctor will register for the vaccine, as well as the vaccination process will take place there at the GP's invitation.

If, after calling a family doctor, a resident finds out that his or her family doctor is not a vaccination service provider , then:

    some general practitioners will register, but will pass on information on applications for the organization of the vaccination process;
    other family doctors will invite residents over the age of 70 to call the free vaccination registration phone number 8989 or, if possible, register at www.manavakcina.lv;
    in both cases, the data will be used to contact the population and at some point invite the population to be vaccinated as close as possible to the territory indicated by the population.

After medical workers will come customers and employees of social care centers, then people in risk groups.

It is currently planned that a total of more than 800 000 people could be provided with a state-paid vaccine. This number could be higher if the vaccine manufacturers approve Latvia's order.

So far, the National Health Service has entered into an agreement on the supply of vaccines with two vaccine manufacturers — AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson (Janssen). The Minister for Health Ilze Viņķele said that €1.6 million has been paid upfront s so that Latvia can receive these vaccines.

It is likely that there will also be an agreement with another potential manufacturer, Pfizer, and altogether there are 7-8 producers in the ministry's lists.

“Latvia will do everything to make vaccines available,” the minister said.

On December 1, the Cabinet of Ministers considered the information report prepared by the Ministry of Health on the vaccination strategy against Covid-19.

To date, none of the vaccine manufacturers who have reported on their vaccine research have registered Covid-19 vaccines. However, the Ministry of Health and the responsible authorities are preparing for the vaccine to be registered and available. To date, the National Health Service has entered into vaccine supply agreements with four vaccine manufacturers - AstraZeneca , Johnson & Johnson (Janssen) , BioNTech / Pfizer , CureVac . The need to contract with several vaccine manufacturers is due to the fact that it is currently not possible to predict whether the registration process for all vaccines will be successful. It is also not possible to determine which vaccines will be the most effective, efficient and safe, and it is not known exactly which vaccines will be available the fastest. The volume of vaccines offered by the four vaccine manufacturers could provide an opportunity to vaccinate approximately one million Latvians.

The European Commission recommends that, depending on the situation in each country, priority groups for people to be vaccinated could be considered. Consequently, the Ministry of Health has determined that the vaccines would be given first to health care workers, then to social care center clients and staff, and then to people over the age of 60, people with chronic illne UPDATE: Whereas in December 2020 three Vaccines were approved for usage in the adult population, now as of the 17th of May 2021, 16-17 year olds maye receive Pfizer-BioNTech",2021-05-17,2021-05-17,2021-05-19,The policy is a one-time measure (e.g. publication of guidelines),Latvia,LVA,LV,National,0,,,,COVID-19 Vaccines,Regulatory approval process for administering the COVID-19 vaccine,,"CureVac vaccine (CVnCoV, CV07050101)",,Emergency regulatory approval or authorization granted,,,,"","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"",Yes,Latvia,"One or more countries, but not all countries",,,,,,,No special population targeted,,,Mandatory (Unspecified/Implied),"National Government,Ministry/Department of Health",,,,,https://tummgmt.eu.qualtrics.com/Q/File.php?F=F_3PMg1aJd0WWSGWh ; https://tummgmt.eu.qualtrics.com/Q/File.php?F=F_1LNX2bjkjW7sh24,NA ; https://covid19.gov.lv/aktualites/no-17-maija-sakas-16-17-gadus-vecu-jauniesu-vakcinacija,WHO EURO,EURO_2636708_1,2021-12-10,2021-12-10T13:38:05Z,128125,2269,117799,4112,2448070,1306.391,,538754,16319,29.11,8818,22,18.5,2,0.0290234871208668,0.548431634902954,0,58,1942248,29958505945.1773,3.78731375779996,14.4793566230786,24.1230791260334,2,2,1.43560269320935,1.39724850797043,265418

Vaccination against Covid-19 will be voluntary, including for healthcare professionals. Taking into account the gradual entry of vaccines into the market, the most vulnerable groups within Latvian society will be vaccinated first.

The aim is to ensure the ongoing operation of the health care system, as well as to reduce the burden of mortality and morbidity on the health care system.

The first vaccines will be given to healthcare workers working with Covid-19 patients in hospitals and to the Emergency Medical Service. Afterwards, vaccines will be provided to the following groups in this order:

    Other health care workers;
    Employees and clients of social care centres;
    People with chronic diseases;
    People over the age of 60;
    People working in operational services;
    Employees of medical institutions;
    People in places of imprisonment;
    All other residents of Latvia. It is planned that all other residents of Latvia will be able to be vaccinated starting from the second quarter of 2021.

From 1 August 2020, new conditions will apply to migrant workers, including cultural workers. The new procedure stipulates that foreigners will have to take the Covid-19 test before starting work. This means that the person will have to be in self-isolation until he/ she receives a negative result of the analysis and only then will he/ she be able to go to perform work duties. The test will need to be repeated a second day after leaving the country subject to the precautionary measures, as Covid-19 infection may be detected later usually on days 5-7 after infection.

""With regard to travel, the Ministry of Health calls for a careful assessment of the necessity. It must be taken into account that when abroad there is not only a higher risk of becoming infected with Covid-19, but also the risk of being quarantined and having to observe that quarantine in the specific country. At the same time, it must be borne in mind that the external border of the EU is not currently open for travel, meaning that travel to third countries is not possible. Travel is also not possible to those EU and EEA countries which are published on the SPKC website as countries with a high risk to public health (a 14-day cumulative number of Covid-19 cases that exceeds 25 per 100,000 inhabitants) and, upon entering Latvia from a country where the 14-day cumulative number of Covid-19 cases per 100,000 inhabitants exceeds 15, 14-day self-isolation will have to be observed from the day of leaving that country."" UPDATE: Along with other amendments to the MK rules, the government agreed that the list of countries published by the Center for Disease Prevention and Control (CDC) after August 17, when the rules come into force, will henceforth be valid from the day after its publication. Until now, every Friday SPKC published a list of countries from which 14-day self-isolation must be observed upon return. This practice will continue in the future, but the conditions will apply to persons who will return to Latvia starting from Saturday.

Improved testing policies will focus on large-scale, targeted and regular community screening, ensuring early detection and early control of communicable diseases. Such an approach would increase the chances of gradually reducing restrictive measures and expanding the availability of services while controlling the spread of the virus

In order to implement regular and extensive public screening, it is planned to further improve the availability of testing throughout Latvia and, in addition to the existing Covid-19 analysis transfer points, to expand off-site testing and the involvement of GPs. Covid-19 tests will be more widely available on weekends.

Also, with the emergence of new strains of Covid-19, it is planned to increase the amount of sequencing, which allows constant monitoring of virus variability or mutation detection. This is an important step in the timely detection and prevention of the spread of new strains of the virus in society.",2021-02-16,2021-02-16,,The policy’s end date is unknown or unreported,Latvia,LVA,LV,National,0,,,,Health Monitoring,A person’s absolute (e.g. GPS) location over time,,"",,,,,,"","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"",Yes,Latvia,"One or more countries, but not all countries",,,,,,,No special population targeted,,,Voluntary/Recommended but No Penalties,National Government,,,,,https://tummgmt.eu.qualtrics.com/Q/File.php?F=F_2YVVSHef69DI6Lb,https://www.mk.gov.lv/lv/parskata-covid-19-testesanas-politiku-pielagojot-aktualajai-situacijai,WHO EURO,EURO_1261976_1,2021-12-29,2021-12-29T13:54:18Z,77697,1486,65450,12908,1327354,708.331,,40407,998,2.18,539,22,18.5,2,0.0290234871208668,0.548431634902954,0,58,1942248,29958505945.1773,3.78731375779996,14.4793566230786,24.1230791260334,2,2,1.43560269320935,1.39724850797043,265418

To date, none of the vaccine manufacturers who have reported on their vaccine research have registered Covid-19 vaccines. However, the Ministry of Health and the responsible authorities are preparing for the vaccine to be registered and available. To date, the National Health Service has entered into vaccine supply agreements with four vaccine manufacturers - AstraZeneca , Johnson & Johnson (Janssen) , BioNTech / Pfizer , CureVac . The need to contract with several vaccine manufacturers is due to the fact that it is currently not possible to predict whether the registration process for all vaccines will be successful. It is also not possible to determine which vaccines will be the most effective, efficient and safe, and it is not known exactly which vaccines will be available the fastest. The volume of vaccines offered by the four vaccine manufacturers could provide an opportunity to vaccinate approximately one million Latvians.

The European Commission recommends that, depending on the situation in each country, priority groups for people to be vaccinated could be considered. Consequently, the Ministry of Health has determined that the vaccines would be given first to health care workers, then to social care center clients and staff, and then to people over the age of 60, people with chronic illnesses, emergency department staff and educational staff.

Vaccines contain substances, or agents, that stimulate the body’s immunity. There are different types of vaccines. Some vaccines contain weakened or killed versions of certain viruses, bacteria, or their parts. Other vaccines contain a messenger (meaning that it merely holds information about the virus and is not the virus itself, so it cannot cause the disease or make it worse if you already have it). When a person is given the vaccine, the body’s immune system makes antibodies. When a person is exposed to a real infectious virus or bacterium, their immune system remembers it. It activates specific antibodies that have already been made, kills the virus or bacteria, and does not make you sick.
How is a vaccine developed and registered?
In order to be used in the European Union, a vaccine must meet the same standards of proof of safety, quality, and effectiveness as any other medicine. No exceptions from these essential requirements are made. More than 200 Covid-19 vaccines are currently being developed worldwide, but some are already close to the final stage.

The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is the first to complete this registration process. The next known vaccines that are coming close to the final stage, at which the European Medicines Agency can decide on their registration, are those developed by AstraZeneca and Moderna.

The process of developing and registering these vaccines is faster than for other vaccines, due to the investment and pooling of",2020-12-28,2020-12-28,2020-12-30,The policy is a one-time measure (e.g. publication of guidelines),Latvia,LVA,LV,National,1,,,,Public Awareness Measures,Disseminating information related to COVID-19 to the public that is reliable and factually accurate,,"",,,,,,"","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"",Yes,Latvia,"One or more countries, but not all countries",,,,,,All Residents (Citizen Residents + Foreign Residents),No special population targeted,,,Voluntary/Recommended but No Penalties,"National Government,Ministry/Department of Health",56.76452793262,53.4027165329683,49.9689242348733,47,https://tummgmt.eu.qualtrics.com/Q/File.php?F=F_2zf2vZeXnB0zp7t,http://web.archive.org/web/20210111233236/https://covid19.gov.lv/en/vaccine,OxCGRT,OXCGRT_Latvia_20201228_vax,2021-11-30,2021-11-30T14:59:01Z,36838,578,25533,4437,841442,449.028,,648,90,0.04,49,22,18.5,2,0.0290234871208668,0.548431634902954,0,58,1942248,29958505945.1773,3.78731375779996,14.4793566230786,24.1230791260334,2,2,1.43560269320935,1.39724850797043,265418

It is planned to vaccinate up to 70% of the Latvian population by the end of the summer, according to the informative report of the Ministry of Health ""On the Covid-19 vaccination plan"", which was heard today by the Cabinet of Ministers.

Minister of Health Daniels Pavļuts: “The vaccination plan we approved in government today is detailed, digital and flexible. Uncertainty is the only certainty of the time, now we will be ready to act in different situations. Both when there is a delay in the supply of vaccines and when there are a lot of them. ”

The updated vaccination plan is designed to make optimal use of the resources of the vaccination system and to implement a convenient and flexible vaccination process. The plan sets out a number of basic principles:

    the establishment of common lists of vaccinees, which will make it possible to maintain contact between those who have expressed an interest in vaccination and the location of the population in the priority group, as well as vaccination sites,
    the creation of a common calendar and queue to help plan the workload and opening hours of vaccination points and the management of records,
    centralized supply of vaccines and stockpile management,
    unified communication with the population.

If the family doctor is also a provider of vaccination services (the family doctor will be able to tell you during the interview), then the family doctor will register for the vaccine, as well as the vaccination process will take place there at the GP's invitation.

If, after calling a family doctor, a resident finds out that his or her family doctor is not a vaccination service provider , then:

    some general practitioners will register, but will pass on information on applications for the organization of the vaccination process;
    other family doctors will invite residents over the age of 70 to call the free vaccination registration phone number 8989 or, if possible, register at www.manavakcina.lv;

The procedure stipulates that medical institutions will provide vaccinations for residents who have registered with manavakcina.lv and by phone 8989, as well as vaccinations for residents who have individually applied to medical institutions, including GP practices that will not provide vaccination. In such cases, the GP will compile a list of people to be vaccinated and send it to the vaccination institution with which the practice contract has been concluded.

When making the record, GPs should, as far as possible, take into account the age and health status of the vaccinees, giving priority to the elderly or people with more severe chronic diseases, depending on the priority group to be vaccinated.

It is also stipulated that when creating a vaccination record, vaccination is provided as a priority to the population who are scheduled for primary vaccination or who are in the highest priority vaccination group.

Vaccination for patients who require serious medical manipulation as determined by a doctor, including high-cost or high-complexity surgery (eg oncology patients, before or during chemotherapy, patients and donors before organ or stem cell transplantation, long-term inpatient care) ) will be performed in a medical institution according to a doctor’s referral.

In order to prevent the loss of vaccine doses, it is envisaged that the vaccination institution will establish reserve lists of vaccinees from the current group of the population to be vaccinated as a priority or the next group to be vaccinated as a priority. This will allow for the prompt replacement of vaccinees in the event that someone does not arrive. If, at the end of the day of vaccination, there is still a stockpile of unused doses of vaccine in the vaccination establishment that cannot be maintained for the next day, it is permissible to vaccinate people outside the specified priority vaccination group. At the same time, the number of people in the vial should not exceed the number of doses and such vaccination should be documented and justified. Doses written off that have not been vaccinated by the end of the day should also be documented and justified.",2021-02-25,2021-02-25,2021-03-12,The policy has an imprecise natural end date (e.g. masks will be distributed until they run out),Latvia,LVA,LV,National,1,,,,Public Awareness Measures,Disseminating information related to COVID-19 to the public that is reliable and factually accurate,,"",,,,,,"","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"",Yes,Latvia,"One or more countries, but not all countries",,,,,,All Residents (Citizen Residents + Foreign Residents),No special population targeted,,,Voluntary/Recommended but No Penalties,"National Government,Ministry/Department of Health",,,,,https://tummgmt.eu.qualtrics.com/Q/File.php?F=F_3ERfpmEPupnciKl ; https://tummgmt.eu.qualtrics.com/Q/File.php?F=F_2t3xx1vlXsOt4Hf,NA ; https://covid19.gov.lv/aktualites/noteikta-vienota-kartiba-vakcinacijai-pret-covid-19,WHO EURO,EURO_735776_1,2021-12-03,2021-12-03T17:12:41Z,84258,1593,73285,12232,1418268,756.846,,59796,2253,3.23,1217,22,18.5,2,0.0290234871208668,0.548431634902954,0,58,1942248,29958505945.1773,3.78731375779996,14.4793566230786,24.1230791260334,2,2,1.43560269320935,1.39724850797043,265418

This weekend, in seven Latvian cities - Riga, Daugavpils, Liepaja, Rezekne, Jelgava, Jurmala and Cesis, everyone who wants it will have the opportunity to get vaccinated. Vaccination will be carried out with the manufacturer's AstraZeneca vaccines, and the public will be able to receive the vaccine on arrival at large-scale vaccination centers in the city.

Citizens who belong to one of the already opened priority groups will be invited to a special line for them, no additional proof of compliance with the priority group will be required. A special line at the specific location will allow you to receive the vaccine more quickly than other people who want to be vaccinated. Other people who want to be vaccinated will be directed to the second line. Vaccinations will have a pre-determined amount of vaccine in each city. Once the vaccines have been used up, the vaccination center will close on that day.

With the significant increase in morbidity rates with Covid-19, the 14-day cumulative rate has also noticeably increased. Currently, in Latvia, it is 19.5 per 100,000 inhabitants.

Until now, when returning to Latvia from the countries of the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom, where the indicator was above 16, self-isolation had to be observed.

The requirement to self-isolate will remain for vaccinated/recovered people only when traveling from countries with a particularly high risk to public health (Emergency brake regulation: very high-risk country or new covid-19 variant). Also, children under the age of 12 should follow the same rules of self-isolation as their companions.

However, for 10 days after entry, those children will not be allowed to contact people outside their household, attend public events, children’s groups, go camping, school, or kindergarten, or use public transport.

September 17th, 2020

On Tuesday, September 15, 2020, the Cabinet of Ministers, taking into account the advice of experts and the latest research data, decided to shorten the period of self-isolation after entering from abroad to 10 days instead of the previous 14 days. 
Making amendments to the regulations of the MK no. 360 In order to limit the infection of Covid-19, the government has created an opportunity for residents to return to their daily routines sooner after arriving in Latvia from countries where the level of spread of Covid-19 poses a serious threat to society. These amendments do not apply to those cases where home quarantine must be observed - its period still remains 14 days.
The amendments approved by the Cabinet of Ministers will enter into force on September 17 and will also apply to people who are already self-isolating. UPDATE: From Wednesday, June 16, 2021, the ban on non-essential travel, the requirement to pass the Covid-19 test and self-isolate when entering Latvia will be lifted if an individual can present a digital Covid-19 certificate confirming the completion of vaccination or recovery from the disease.",2021-06-15,2021-06-16,,The policy’s end date is unknown or unreported,Latvia,LVA,LV,National,0,,,,Quarantine,Self-Quarantine (i.e. quarantine at home),,"",,,,,,"","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"",No,All countries,All countries,,,,,,All Travelers (Citizen Travelers + Foreign Travelers ),No special population targeted,Inbound,All kinds of transport,Mandatory (Unspecified/Implied),Other (Please specify in the text box),,,,,https://tummgmt.eu.qualtrics.com/Q/File.php?F=F_0MNzwSXtLU0OqKa ; https://tummgmt.eu.qualtrics.com/Q/File.php?F=F_1f6MRZMcV37nnCj,NA ; https://eng.lsm.lv/article/economy/transport/latvia-travel-entry-rules-from-june-16.a409253/,WHO EURO,"EURO_1256369_1, EURO_3308576_1",2022-12-08,2022-12-08T14:06:54Z,136403,2475,131480,9053,2762743,1474.313,,1001573,11947,54.12,6456,22,18.5,2,0.0290234871208668,0.548431634902954,0,58,1942248,29958505945.1773,3.78731375779996,14.4793566230786,24.1230791260334,2,2,1.43560269320935,1.39724850797043,265418

With the reopening of some of Latvias treatments, the government has enlisted a new set of public guidelines for healthcare professionals.

At the same time, medical institutions must take a number of precautions. They will be able to provide these health care services from 9:00 to 16:00, providing a flow of individual patients. It will also be necessary to limit the number of patients staying on the premises of the treatment facility at the same time and to set a precise time of arrival for the healthcare.

Medical facilities will require both physicians and patients to provide personal protective equipment, and disinfection should be performed after each patient visit.

Medical authorities will also be required, as far as possible, to initially provide healthcare to those who have previously been discharged due to an emergency.

It should be emphasized that some planned health care services will still not be available in either public or private medical institutions. At the same time, as before, emergency medical and acute care will be provided, including the necessary examinations and consultations. GP practices also continue to work.

On June 22 2021, the Latvian government agreed on the new reduced restrictions:
-vaccinated people and people who have had and overcome Covid-19 can gather without restrictions;
-the groups above plus people with negative Covid-19 tests will be able to gather in crowds up to 500 people indoors and up to 1,000 outside;
-those who don't fall into any of the categories will be able to gather up to 20 people indoors and up to 50 outdoors.

With the reopening of some of Latvias treatments, the government has enlisted a new set of public guidelines for healthcare professionals.

At the same time, medical institutions must take a number of precautions. They will be able to provide these health care services from 9:00 to 16:00, providing a flow of individual patients. It will also be necessary to limit the number of patients staying on the premises of the treatment facility at the same time and to set a precise time of arrival for the healthcare.

Medical facilities will require both physicians and patients to provide personal protective equipment, and disinfection should be performed after each patient visit.

Medical authorities will also be required, as far as possible, to initially provide healthcare to those who have previously been discharged due to an emergency.

It should be emphasized that some planned health care services will still not be available in either public or private medical institutions. At the same time, as before, emergency medical and acute care will be provided, including the necessary examinations and consultations. GP practices also continue to work.

At the same time, medical institutions must take a number of precautions. They will be able to provide these health care services from 9:00 to 16:00, providing a flow of individual patients. It will also be necessary to limit the number of patients staying on the premises of the treatment facility at the same time and to set a precise time of arrival for the healthcare.

Medical facilities will require both physicians and patients to provide personal protective equipment, and disinfection should be performed after each patient visit.

Medical authorities will also be required, as far as possible, to initially provide healthcare to those who have previously been discharged due to an emergency.

It should be emphasized that some planned health care services will still not be available in either public or private medical institutions.
