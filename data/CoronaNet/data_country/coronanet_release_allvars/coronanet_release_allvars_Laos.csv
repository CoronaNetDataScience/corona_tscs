Lao People's Democratic Republic Prime Minister's Order, dated March 23, 2020: Entertainment venues, including karaoke venues, bars, spas, nightmarkets, and other venues of entertainment activities are very crowded and high-risk. For hotels, resorts, guest houses, factories, restaurants, and tourist services: services can be operated normally but owners must enact activities including basic preventive measures, such as temperature monitoring, water supply, hand washing, and limiting the number of people entering the service area without crowding and with safe distances.

As of June 30, Casinos will be allowed to resume operations, according to the notice, but must also comply with covid prevention measures.

Social gatherings, weddings, parties, and traditional festivals may now be held, however, organizers must follow strict guidelines laid out by the national taskforce.

Meanwhile, entertainment venues including karaoke bars, nightclubs, and internet cafes will remain closed in order to prevent a second wave of the Covid-19 virus appearing in Laos.
