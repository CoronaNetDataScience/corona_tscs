World Mask Week (WMW) aims to reinforce the importance of wearing a face mask to reduce the spread of COVID-19. In the absence of a vaccine that can prevent infection, and as COVID-19 cases increase globally, citizens must depend on non-pharmaceutical measures, which include the use of face masks, hand washing, physical distancing and supportive management of confirmed cases to mitigate the impact of the disease.

World Mask Week, an initiative from a coalition of organisations including the Pandemic Action Network (PAN), World Health Organisation (WHO), Africa CDC and private companies working to mitigate the effects of COVID-19 globally, will run from August 7th -14th 2020.",2020-08-07,2020-08-07,2020-08-14,The policy has a clear end date,Nigeria,NGA,NG,National,1,,,,Public Awareness Measures,Both Disseminating and Gathering information related to COVID-19,,"",,,,,,"","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"",Yes,Nigeria,"One or more countries, but not all countries",,,,,,All Residents (Citizen Residents + Foreign Residents),No special population targeted,,,Voluntary/Recommended but No Penalties,"National Government,Ministry/Department of Health,Ministry/Department of Education,New (COVID-19 specific) Task Force",62.4112014143068,59.6200020558431,56.8736279462142,72,https://tummgmt.eu.qualtrics.com/Q/File.php?F=F_2tDTTC58IqlbWQk,https://ncdc.gov.ng/news/259/nigeria-commemorates-world-mask-week,2020-11-26,2020-11-26T16:13:58Z,45687,936,32637,3835,310729,1.456,,,,,,115,35.6,0,0.570289313793182,0.548431634902954,18,27,190873311,460456500518.741,0.805886619492881,19.0671204727409,26.8554842267658,0,0,-1.55832119712123,-0.585950705411928,1199115
