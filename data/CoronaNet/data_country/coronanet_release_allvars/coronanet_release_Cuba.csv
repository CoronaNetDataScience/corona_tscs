“This is the first contact with the crew that comes on the plane, precisely for the analysis of documents and the creation of the general statement of the aircraft,” said Trujillo, who noted that this statement “reflects all the general data of the aircraft,” including the model, number of passengers on board, number and condition of the people on board and if there were any incidents on the trip.

Authorities say that the resurgence in coronavirus cases in the capital – and they have increased from zero in mid-July to several dozen per day during the second half of August – justifies the restrictions, which will remain in force for at least the next two weeks.

The suspension of the collection of the extension, which allows those who have exceeded the time established by the island’s immigration law to maintain residence in Cuba, had been decreed last March due to the coronavirus pandemic. Its objective then, explained Soberón, was “to guarantee that Cubans who were abroad when flights between Cuba and abroad became difficult due to the pandemic, maintain their permanent residence in Cuba without having to carry out any consular procedures or go to any consulate, since it was a situation that was beyond these citizens’ will.”",2020-10-20,2020-10-20,,The policy’s end date is unknown or unreported,Cuba,CUB,CU,National,1,,,,"New Task Force, Bureau or Administrative Configuration",Other Administrative Configurations,,"",,,,,,"","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"",Yes,Cuba,"One or more countries, but not all countries",,,,,,All Residents (Citizen Residents + Foreign Residents),Other population not specifed above,,,Mandatory (Unspecified/Implied),Ministry/Department of Foreign Affairs,67.1520196191833,63.1278101749804,59.3523509119252,102,https://tummgmt.eu.qualtrics.com/Q/File.php?F=F_2fv2aKnwSQ9jq88,https://oncubanews.com/en/cuba/minrex-no-cost-extension-for-cubans-abroad-will-be-maintained-until-flights-are-normalized/,2022-03-13,2022-03-13T11:49:54Z,6305,127,5806,6719,763342,67.814,,,,,,171,63.8,1,-0.343750506639481,-0.677624106407166,5,47,11338138,77290916752.7022,2.24848039303581,16.2436826452511,25.070842279202,2,0,0.0677032588566732,-0.881810394737796,4886
