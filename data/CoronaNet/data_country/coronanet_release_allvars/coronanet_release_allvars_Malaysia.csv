Muhyiddin said this means that all business premises have to be shut down, except for outlets such as supermarkets and grocery stores selling daily essentials. He said all government and private premises would be closed during the movement control order, except for essential services such as utilities, telecommunications, transport, banking, health, pharmacies, ports, airports, cleaning and food supplies.

He said that the movement control order also means all Malaysians will be banned from travelling abroad, and that no tourists or foreigners will be allowed to enter the country.

“Malaysian who have returned from abroad have to self-quarantine for 14 days,” he added. Muhyiddin also said that all childcare centres, government and private schools, boarding schools, international schools, tahfiz centres and other secondary, primary and pre-university institutions will also be closed. “All private and public higher learning institutions together with vocational training centres will be closed nationwide,” he said.

The five broad sectors are factories and manufacturing, construction, services, trade and distribution, as well as plantations and commodities. These sectors deemed essential are allowed to operate but with only 30 per cent of management staff allowed at the workplace. Other than the five sectors and their related industries, there is also a catch-all phrase where those not included in the list can be allowed to operate after talks with the relevant authorities and as decided by the Health Minister.
