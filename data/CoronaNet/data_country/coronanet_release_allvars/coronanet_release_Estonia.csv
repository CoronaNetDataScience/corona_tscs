This also gives us an advantage at the negotiations as we would be a very small buyer alone. A bigger volume of orders gives a bigger lever in the current complicated market conditions. The European Union has currently signed pre-purchase agreements with seven vaccine manufacturers whose vaccine candidates show the most promise. A pre-purchase agreement means that once the vaccine is ready, i.e. has passed all the tests, and has obtained a marketing authorisation, the manufacturer has to guarantee that first priority is given to the delivery of the vaccine. Currently Estonia has joined the agreements with the medicine manufacturers AstraZeneca, Jannsen Pharmaceutica NV, Pfizer BioNTech, Curevac, and Moderna. In the European Union joint procurement, the European Commission has also signed an agreement with the vaccine manufacturer Sanofi, which Estonia has the possibility to join later. Negotiations are also under way with the vaccine manufacturer Novavax.  With the AstraZeneca agreement Estonia will acquire COVID-19 vaccines for about 600,000 people, with the Jannsen Pharmaceutica NV agreement for about 300,000 people, with the Pfizer BioNTech agreement for about 300,000 people, with the Curevac agreement for about 330,000 people, with the Moderna agreement for about 117,000 people.
