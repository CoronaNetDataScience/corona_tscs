The passenger must enter this code to proceed with completing the form; a declaration of what documentation / proof of a medical event (vaccination, recovery or RT-PCR test result) the passenger holds; categories of passengers which are exempt from testing or quarantine restrictions can declare their exemption; new fields to capture the data (name, age, proof of medical event) of each child (under 18) which to be listed on the accompanying responsible adult’s form.",2021-07-27,2021-07-27,,The policy’s end date is unknown or unreported,Ireland,IRL,IE,National,0,,,,External Border Restrictions,Travel History Form (e.g. documents where traveler has recently been),,"",,,,,,"","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"",No,All countries,All countries,,,,,,All Travelers (Citizen Travelers + Foreign Travelers ),No special population targeted,Inbound/Outbound,All kinds of transport,Mandatory (Unspecified/Implied),"National Government,Ministry/Department of Health",,,,,https://tummgmt.eu.qualtrics.com/Q/File.php?F=F_3PoT5eJTKNozMTU,https://www.gov.ie/en/press-release/ff30a-enhanced-passenger-locator-form-is-launched/,2022-03-31,2022-03-31T11:23:24Z,295386,5026,23364,17496,6058303,1214.935,,5872940,46086,117.78,9242,13,12.6,2,0.561379015445709,0.823284327983856,0,74,4807388,344958774769.011,8.14529615601917,15.3856644592418,26.5666907534147,2,2,2.34045433478583,3.96682911963476,759256
