He also warned, however, that there should be no complacency, and that measures such as social distancing and hand washing should continue. Dr. Holohan noted that there have been some clusters of cases, and that there could be a second wave of infections, so caution is still necessary. The Irish government has extended the country's lockdown measures until May 5th, but has said that it will consider easing some restrictions after that date if the situation allows.
