The supplement to the action plan describes three tiers to prevent the outbreak from escalating and, in particular, to curb the spread of COVID-19 variants:
- Group leisure activities for children under 12 years of age should not be restricted. However, in tier 2, it is recommended that indoor leisure activities for those under 12 years of age comply with the criteria laid down in the guidelines for safe and secure leisure activities.
- Each leisure activity group always meets in the same composition. This means that the group should not take part in competitions, concerts, performances, shows or other situations in which the group comes into contact with other leisure activity groups. Teachers, instructors and coaches should also always be the same ones. Parents may not spend time in their children’s leisure activities and dressing rooms.
- In most facilities, the number of participants should be limited to 10 people. In big gyms and other large spaces, it is possible for separate groups of 10 people to exercise without any contact between the groups.
- In tier 1, there are no restrictions for group leisure activities outdoors or in restricted outdoor areas.
