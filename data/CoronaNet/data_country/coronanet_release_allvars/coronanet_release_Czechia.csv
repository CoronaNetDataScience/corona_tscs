Also, while Czech citizens can return from medium risk countries of the EU without restrictions, foreigners from medium risk countries still have to present a negative PCR test or quarantine. Both citizens and foreigners from high risk countries of the EU will still have to present a negative PCR or quarantine for 14 days.",2020-06-12,2020-06-15,2020-06-15,The policy has a clear end date,Czechia,CZE,CZ,National,0,,,,External Border Restrictions,Negative COVID-19 Test,,"",,,,,,"","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"",No,All countries,All countries,,,,,,All Travelers (Citizen Travelers + Foreign Travelers ),No special population targeted,Inbound,All kinds of transport,"Mandatory (Unspecified/Implied),Mandatory with Exceptions (Please list exceptions in the text entry)",National Government,,,,,https://tummgmt.eu.qualtrics.com/Q/File.php?F=F_1CCQLvFseS8JIrg,http://hygpraha.cz/dokumenty/vlada-zrychlila-scenar-uvolnovani-mimoradnych-opatreni--od-pondeli-mohou-otevrit-vetsi-provozovny-4816_4816_161_1.html ; http://hygpraha.cz/dokumenty/od-15--cervna-mohou-obcane-eu-vracejici-se-ze-zemi-s-nizkym-a-strednim-rizikem-nakazy-koronavirem-prijet-do-cr-bez-nutnosti-testu-4914_4914_161_1.html ; http://hygpraha.cz/dokumenty/ve-vetsine-evropskych-zemi-je-nizke-riziko-nakazy--cesi-se-budou-muset-prokazat-negativnim-testem-pri-prijezdu-z-portugalska--svedska-a-slezskeho-vojvodstvi-4940_4940_161_1.html,CoronaNet (original),,2021-08-17,2021-08-17T14:07:41Z,10064,330,7296,3889,55968,5.325,,,,,,40,23.5,1,1.95645272731781,0.394925087690353,0,57,10594438,241073815662.396,4.3526035198277,16.175839704389,26.2083690125957,2,2,2.5304864597058,5.48100177577924,416454
