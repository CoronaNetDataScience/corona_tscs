All inbound travelers are required to complete an online Travel Authorization application. Those who are approved are issued a travel certificate, which they must present during the airline check-in process in order to board their flight, as well as upon their arrival in Jamaica. Those coming from high-risk areas of the globe  must complete the questionnaire between 2-5 days prior to their intended arrival in Jamaica, and will receive approval or denial in the 48 hours following form submission. Travelers bound from high-risk regions are required to upload their negative COVID-19 PCR test results to receive Authorization certification. These must be no more than ten days old from the date that the sample was collected to the date of their arrival in Jamaica and must come from a College of American Pathologists (CAP) accredited lab. All visitors will still be screened when they arrive in Jamaica by undergoing non-invasive temperature checks, observation for symptoms and a brief interview with Health Officers.
Short-term business travelers entering the country  must submit a rapid-result swab test upon arrival at the airport  and must remain quarantined until their results become available. Those who pass health checks and test negative on swabs may proceed to enter the country, but must adhere to the ‘Stay in Zone’ order.",2020-07-17,2020-07-15,2020-07-31,The policy has a clear end date,Jamaica,JAM,JM,National,0,,,,Health Monitoring,,,"",,,,,,"","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"",Yes,Jamaica,"One or more countries, but not all countries",,,,,,,No special population targeted,,,Mandatory (Unspecified/Implied),"National Government,Ministry/Department of Health",69.7680918876365,66.7336073180107,64.1030278978968,105,https://tummgmt.eu.qualtrics.com/Q/File.php?F=F_3IXjElpoDpyN0pa,https://www.travelpulse.com/news/destinations/jamaica-announces-newly-revised-measures-for-international-travelers.html,2020-11-23,2020-11-23T10:59:30Z,763,10,647,354,28900,9.719,,,,,,6,10.5,0,-0.824784338474274,0.823284327983856,3,44,2934855,14249490164.8509,1.94087814684517,14.8921686062761,23.3799869651158,2,1,-0.501714779602103,-0.0486890634895364,23468
