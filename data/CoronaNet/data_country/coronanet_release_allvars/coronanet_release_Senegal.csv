The Minister of Health Abdoulaye Diouf Sarr signed yesterday a partnership with the ""gas"" to ensure the security of oxygen and to have a stranglehold on the product.

In other words, the government requisitioned all production as it had done with chloroquine at the start of the pandemic, reports The Daily.

The State has thus taken an option on the production of oxygen from these gas carriers, a product which will be essentially reserved for the health system, in view of the evolution of the pandemic.

Note that the medical authorities have already injected into the circuit 125 thousand m3 of oxygen in the epidemic treatment centers (CTE).",2021-08-03,2021-08-03,2021-08-04,The policy is a one-time measure (e.g. publication of guidelines),Senegal,SEN,SN,National,0,,,,Health Resources,Other Health Materials,,"",,,,,,"","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"",Yes,Senegal,"One or more countries, but not all countries",,,,,,,No special population targeted,,,Mandatory (Unspecified/Implied),Ministry/Department of Health,,,,,https://tummgmt.eu.qualtrics.com/Q/File.php?F=F_2ATsvEH4KsMh4yw,https://www.seneweb.com/news/Societe/quot-materiel-public-vendu-au-prive-quot_n_353950.html,2021-08-03,2021-08-03T12:59:00Z,64024,1394,48378,2723,667477,39.55,,1204245,37211,7.14,2205,47,23.9,0,-0.435670435428619,0.0045911050401628,10,45,15419381,22965194790.3237,7.08292229094889,16.5511357826219,23.8572456367402,2,1,0.374552383477064,-0.0211630997065261,266496

Decree n ° 2020-830 of March 23, 2020 proclaimed a state of emergency on the national territory. This decree had enabled the public authorities to take all measures tending to restrict public freedoms in order to stem the Covid-19 and curb its spread.

However, despite the measures taken, the pandemic has grown to worrying proportions, necessitating the extension of the state of emergency.

This is why and in accordance with article 69 of the Constitution, the National Assembly, by adopting law n ° 2020-13 of 02 April 2020, authorized the President of the Republic to extend the state of emergency for a period of three (3) months.

However, it should be noted that by authorizing the extension of the state of emergency, the National Assembly set a maximum deadline which would not have been exceeded by the Head of State.

Nevertheless, depending on his power to assess the situation, the Head of State can manage this period in sequential phases until the total expiration of these three (3) months if the contingencies justify it.

In other words, it is up to the President of the Republic to assess the sequences of prorogation in the period of three (3) months authorized by the National Assembly.

Thus, for the first sequence, the Head of State decided to extend for thirty (30) days the state of emergency declared by Decree No. 2020-830 of March 23, 2020.

Continuing his communication, the Head of State indicates that, faced with the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic, there is an urgent need to redouble vigilance, commitment and resilience to contain, as quickly as possible, the disease in through individual and collective respect for barrier measures and preventive health precautions.

In view of the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic on our economy and the balance of our society, the President of the Republic underlines the need to anticipate and act in ""Diligence"" and ""Fast Track"" modes. It is therefore a question of speeding up the procedures, mobilizing all the human and financial resources required, in order to vaccinate, as soon as possible, the priority target populations identified.

As such, the Head of State asks the Minister of Health and Social Action, in conjunction with the Minister of Finance and Budget and the Ministers concerned, to take all health, logistical, financial and of social mobilization, necessary for the launching on the whole of the national territory, of the vaccination campaigns, at the end of February 2021 at the latest.

The President of the Republic also asks the Minister of Health and Social Action to raise awareness among health actors and populations, on respecting medical appointments and regular attendance at health structures, while paying particular attention to the optimal progress of the Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI).

Like last year, the COVID-19 pandemic will not allow us to hold the traditional parade. I will therefore preside at the Palace of the Republic a ceremony of raising the colors, in the presence of the Presidents of the constitutional institutions and members of the government.

The disease is still there, indeed. The battle is not yet won, even if our results are appreciable thanks to our common efforts. So, let's not slack off. Let's continue to wear our masks and respect all health recommendations against the spread of the virus.

I reiterate, once again, our gratitude to our medical and paramedical staff, as well as to the support staff, for their dedication in the fight against the pandemic and the smooth running of the vaccination campaign; as evidenced by the massive support of the population.
