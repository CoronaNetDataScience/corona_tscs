Pupils should come into contact with a few teachers as possible during one day or period. If there are no other possibilities, it is suggested that the school operates in shifts. For instance, half of the classes could attend school for one week, and the second half next week. In the event of a child exhibiting symptoms, he or she is separated from others and parents come to pick up their child, but there is no need to panic, and an epidemiologist should only be contacted if several children start showing symptoms. If a child tests positive for COVID-19, the entire class or kindergarten group will undergo self-isolation. classes in lower grades of primary school would follow the bubble model so pupils will not leave the classroom, they will have controlled access to the toilet, their teacher will be with them all the time and they will not mix with children from other classes.
