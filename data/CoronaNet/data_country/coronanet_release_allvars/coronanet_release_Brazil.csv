R_2TMpBkgSKdeVxYqCg,9743698,new_entry,,,"","On March 24, 2020, State Governor Helder Barbalho signed a contract with a company from São Paulo, which operates in the infrastructure and engineering sector, to set up field hospitals that will serve patients with covid-19. Four temporary hospital structures will be installed: one in Belém (RMB), one in Marabá (Carajás region), another in Santarém (Tapajós region) and one in Breves (Marajó). Altogether there are 720 more beds being offered in the public health network. Each bed will cost, on average, R $ 5,000 for the State. 

In contract, the company presented an architectural project based on ABNT (Brazilian Association of Technical Standards) standards and other regulations of the Ministry of Labor. In it, the company suggests installing field hospitals in Convention Centers or similar structures. But it also makes it clear that the project can be changed if another type of
space is made available.

The result, according to FVS-AM, shows that the percentage of contaminated follows the average recorded in the first week, in tests by other professionals, such as in the areas of safety (36%) and health (38%), which subsequently presented rate reduction.

The results of the rapid tests, the active surveillance work with education professionals and the epidemiological situation of Covid-19 in Amazonas were presented, this Friday afternoon (08/21), by the president-director of FVS-AM, Rosemary da Costa Pinto, to representatives of the Public Prosecutor's Office (MPE) and Federal (MPF), the Public Prosecutor's Office (MPT) and the Public Defender's Office (DPE), in addition to the Union of Workers in Education (Sinteam).

Rapid tests for education professionals began to be carried out by the Government of Amazonas last Tuesday. In three days, 534 professionals were tested, of which 162 were positive, of which 139 had positive IGM and IGG, which indicates that, although they already have antibodies to Covid-19, the virus remains active. As established in the protocol for resuming face-to-face classes, professionals who tested positive were removed for the necessary isolation period.

In addition, the city also reported that it suspended, on average, 60% of the entire public transport system by bus in Belém as a preventive measure to covid-19. 

“The suspension of the BRT, together with the reduction in the bus fleet in the city, can directly damage the population, such as, for example, the increase in the capacity of the collective, the accumulation of people at the stops and inside the vehicles, in addition to the worsening in the service provided ”, added the attorney general.
