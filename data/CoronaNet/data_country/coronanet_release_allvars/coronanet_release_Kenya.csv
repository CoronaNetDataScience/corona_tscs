All supermarkets are directed to determine the number of shoppers based on the size of their premises. A queue management system must be established to manage crowds outside the supermarket with preference given to the elderly, expectant mothers and people living with disability. Similarly, supermarkets and other such establishments are to encourage home delivery services while maintaining high standards of hygiene. All supermarket facilities must also disinfect their facilities several times daily. This requirement extends to malls and other such like shopping facilities. Where feasible we encourage supermarkets to operate on a 24-hour basis and upon request the Government will facilitate the provision of the necessary security personnel"".
c. Disinfection of open air markets, ""Open air markets including vegetable, mitumba and bazaars are high risk transmission environments. The management of local markets are directed to ensure that the premises are disinfected regularly to maintain high standards of hygiene. Vegetable markets in particular are required to ensure that their goods are displayed on raised platforms, waste and other garbage is collected daily"".
