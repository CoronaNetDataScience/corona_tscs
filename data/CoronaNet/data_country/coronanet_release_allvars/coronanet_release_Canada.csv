“The COVID-19 pandemic has added extra stress to the daily life of all Manitobans and it is magnified in the lives of those at risk of an opioid overdose,” said Friesen. “They may be experiencing the effects of social distancing, self-isolation, changes to health-care service access, changing drug trends and increased stress responses. Allowing people to receive two kits at a time will reduce travel to naloxone distribution sites, increase resources in the community and help people address social distancing requirements.”",2020-06-19,2020-06-19,2020-06-20,The policy is a one-time measure (e.g. publication of guidelines),Canada,CAN,CA,Provincial,0,Manitoba,,,Health Resources,Unspecified Health Staff,,"",,,,,,"","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"",Yes,Canada,One or more provinces within one or more countries,,Manitoba,,,,,Other population not specifed above,,,Voluntary/Recommended but No Penalties,Provincial/State Government,65.0275025753691,62.4324951482325,59.6608527866098,77,https://tummgmt.eu.qualtrics.com/Q/File.php?F=F_2dRw7jV4hhLalVf,https://news.gov.mb.ca/news/index.html?item=48475&posted=2020-06-19,2021-06-04,2021-06-04T16:53:23Z,101026,8519,64318,47073,2402050,62.955,,,,,,16,15.2,2,1.95645272731781,0.00807896722108126,0,81,37058856,1904517921827.96,1.89697475634192,17.4280179094837,28.2752500330744,2,2,2.07467821016354,0.923360329931059,7960657

This builds on a $1.2-million investment for homeless shelters announced in April and will support:
• expanded capacity at a Main Street Project (MSP) location on Disraeli Street in Winnipeg for the next three months, providing space for 180 beds every night ($135,000);
• continued operation of a site on Sargent Avenue in Winnipeg, which has 39 beds for individuals who may need to self-isolate due to COVID-19, to be managed by MSP until the end of September ($242,000); and
