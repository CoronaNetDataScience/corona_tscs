R_1mntPF3SfGTH7URGc,2839477Gc,new_entry,,,"","On August 18, British Columbia Education Minister Rob Fleming unveiled plans for back-to-class learning in September with students divided into cohorts of their peers — a cluster of 60-120 students that is meant to allow for social interaction, while limiting the potential for widespread COVID-19 transmission. The superintendent of the largest district in B.C., Jordan Tinney, explained that secondary students in Grades 10-12 will only have 30 peers in their cohort and students in Grades 8 and 9 will have 60. B.C. students will be back in class by Sept. 10. To help with this, Surrey secondary schools will implement staggered start, break and dismissal times to limit hallway interactions. The district plan also included controlled traffic flow, regular hand-washing, and enhanced cleaning of buildings.

“The COVID-19 pandemic has added extra stress to the daily life of all Manitobans and it is magnified in the lives of those at risk of an opioid overdose,” said Friesen. “They may be experiencing the effects of social distancing, self-isolation, changes to health-care service access, changing drug trends and increased stress responses. Allowing people to receive two kits at a time will reduce travel to naloxone distribution sites, increase resources in the community and help people address social distancing requirements.”",2020-06-19,2020-06-19,2020-06-21,The policy is a one-time measure (e.g. publication of guidelines),Canada,CAN,CA,Provincial,0,Manitoba,,,Health Resources,Unspecified Health Staff,,"",,,,,,"","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"",Yes,Canada,One or more provinces within one or more countries,,Manitoba,,,,,Other population not specifed above,,,Voluntary/Recommended but No Penalties,Provincial/State Government,https://tummgmt.eu.qualtrics.com/Q/File.php?F=F_2dRw7jV4hhLalVf,https://news.gov.mb.ca/news/index.html?item=48475&posted=2020-06-19,CoronaNet (original),,2021-06-04,2021-06-04T18:53:23Z,101026,8519,64318,47073,2402050,62.955,,,,,,16,15.2,2,1.95645272731781,0.00807896722108126,0,81,37058856,1904517921827.96,1.89697475634192,17.4280179094837,28.2752500330744,2,2,2.07467821016354,0.923360329931059,7960657

“As we continue to respond to COVID-19 together, we must ensure there are services in place to support those who are most vulnerable including people experiencing homelessness,” said Stefanson. “These investments will help ensure trusted community-based organizations can extend or expand their supports, so everyone has a safe place when they need it.”
 
This builds on a $1.2-million investment for homeless shelters announced in April and will support:
• expanded capacity at a Main Street Project (MSP) location on Disraeli Street in Winnipeg for the next three months, providing space for 180 beds every night ($135,000);
