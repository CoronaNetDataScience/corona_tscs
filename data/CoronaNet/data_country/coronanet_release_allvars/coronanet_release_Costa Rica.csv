Under the slogan """"Con vos podemos"""", the official campaign was launched to receive financial donations in order to bring humanitarian aid to vulnerable people and families affected by the emergency caused by Covid-19.

The campaign -which will last until April 30- is promoted by the Government of the Republic together with the Costa Rican Banking Association (ABC), the Federation of Savings and Credit Cooperatives (FEDEAC) and kölbi.

This campaign is a public-private alliance so that people can make their financial donation, which will be translated into basic supplies such as food and hygiene kits for vulnerable families.

The inputs will be purchased from national farmers, enterprises and businesses in each community, which will in turn allow the local economy to be reactivated.

The distribution will be in charge of the Municipal Emergency Committees and food will arrive at the beneficiaries' house to avoid crowds.

On Thursday, April 16, Grupo Mutual and Mutual Cartago (MUCAP) joined the “Con vos Podemos” campaign, enabling their accounts so that people can make their donations by electronic transfer or Sinpe Móvil.",2020-04-14,2020-04-16,2020-04-30,The policy has a clear end date,Costa Rica,CRI,CR,National,1,,,,"New Task Force, Bureau or Administrative Configuration",Other Administrative Configurations,,"",,,,,,"","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"",Yes,Costa Rica,"One or more countries, but not all countries",,,,,,All Residents (Citizen Residents + Foreign Residents),No special population targeted,,,Mandatory (Unspecified/Implied),"National Government,Other (Please specify in the text box)",https://tummgmt.eu.qualtrics.com/Q/File.php?F=F_2bNQA5ZJdEtJGYO,https://www.presidencia.go.cr/comunicados/2020/04/lanzan-campana-nacional-con-vos-podemos-para-apoyar-a-familias-afectadas-por-covid-19/,CoronaNet (original),,2020-07-31,2020-07-31T10:09:34Z,642,4,74,214,7233,1.403,,,,,,7,10.5,2,-0.824784338474274,0.104782894253731,1,59,4949954,48174285762.662,3.3971817013755,15.4148888415724,24.5980912252451,2,2,1.93214813558739,1.44861243900784,411697

The Board of Directors of the Central Bank of Costa Rica (BCCR), in a session held on Monday, April 13, 2020, empowered its Administration to acquire, in the secondary market, holdings from the Ministry of Finance in colones for a maximum amount of ₡ 250,000 million.

The acquisition in the secondary market by the Central Bank of titles of the Ministry of Finance does not constitute financing to the Government, since the purchase of the holdings would be made to a third party, who would be the one who receives the money for the acquisition made by the Central Bank.

Given that this instrument is an exceptional mechanism, the Central Bank restricts its participation to situations of systemic tension, and therefore limits the amount of its intervention and imposes restrictions on the type of holdings that can be acquired and their issue and placement date.

The Central Bank will publish on its website the information on the secondary market transactions carried out under this agreement, at the end of each day in which it carries out said transactions.",2020-04-15,2020-04-15,,The policy’s end date is unknown or unreported,Costa Rica,CRI,CR,National,0,,,,Other Policy Not Listed Above,,,"",,,,,,"","","","","","","","","","","",Board of Directors of the BCCR authorizes the purchase of Treasury holdings in the secondary market in the situation of systemic liquidity stress,,,"",Yes,Costa Rica,"One or more countries, but not all countries",,,,,,,No special population targeted,,,Mandatory (Unspecified/Implied),Other (Please specify in the text box),https://tummgmt.eu.qualtrics.com/Q/File.php?F=F_1SOSP9gANOD2szD,https://www.bccr.fi.cr/seccion-noticias/Noticia/CPrensa_Mercadosecundario_15_04_2020.aspx,CoronaNet (original),,2021-06-04,2021-06-04T09:36:57Z,626,4,67,193,7019,1.362,,,,,,7,10.5,2,-0.824784338474274,0.104782894253731,1,59,4949954,48174285762.662,3.3971817013755,15.4148888415724,24.5980912252451,2,2,1.93214813558739,1.44861243900784,411697
