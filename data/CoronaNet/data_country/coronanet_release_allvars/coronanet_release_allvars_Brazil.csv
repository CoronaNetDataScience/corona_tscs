The project works to improve screening practices in emergency rooms to care for patients with different diagnoses, including those with severe acute flu syndrome (SRAG) and Covid-19. The strategy observes preventive actions against the in-hospital Covid-19 transmission.

According to the director-president of the FVS-AM, Rosemary Costa Pinto, the action will be important to emphasize the good practices of prevention and control of infection already practiced in the state. ""These are improvements in preventing the transmission of Covid-19 and serve as an example for other locations,"" he said.

The coordinator of the Commission and Services for Infection Control Related to Health Care (Ceciss), from FVS-AM, Tatyana Amorim, pointed out that the improvements include different approaches.

Of this total, 162 (30%) tested positive and were taken off for isolation. The result, according to FVS-AM, shows that the percentage of contaminated follows the average recorded in the first week, in tests by other professionals, such as in the areas of safety (36%) and health (38%), which subsequently presented rate reduction.

The results of the rapid tests, the active surveillance work with education professionals and the epidemiological situation of Covid-19 in Amazonas were presented, this Friday afternoon (08/21), by the president-director of FVS-AM, Rosemary da Costa Pinto, to representatives of the Public Prosecutor's Office (MPE) and Federal (MPF), the Public Prosecutor's Office (MPT) and the Public Defender's Office (DPE), in addition to the Union of Workers in Education (Sinteam).

Rapid tests for education professionals began to be carried out by the Government of Amazonas last Tuesday. In three days, 534 professionals were tested, of which 162 were positive, of which 139 had positive IGM and IGG, which indicates that, although they already have antibodies to Covid-19, the virus remains active. As established in the protocol for resuming face-to-face classes, professionals who tested positive were removed for the necessary isolation period.

In addition, the city also reported that it suspended, on average, 60% of the entire public transport system by bus in Belém as a preventive measure to covid-19. 

“The suspension of the BRT, together with the reduction in the bus fleet in the city, can directly damage the population, such as, for example, the increase in the capacity of the collective, the accumulation of people at the stops and inside the vehicles, in addition to the worsening in the service provided ”, added the attorney general.
