•	In the light of the precautionary principle, all non-essential travel to and from the UK should be discouraged until further notice.
•	However, EU citizens and UK citizens travelling to their Member State or country of residence as well as third-country nationals that enjoy EU free movement rights should be exempted from further temporary restrictions provided that they undergo a test or quarantine.
•	Travellers with an essential function, for instance medical staff, should be required to undergo a test (RT-PCR test or a rapid antigen test within 72 hours prior to departure), but should not be required to undergo quarantine while exercising this essential function.
•	Transit of passengers, especially for essential travel, should be facilitated without quarantine. A test can be required, but authorities need to inform about such requirement in advance or offer testing during the journey.
•	Given the need to ensure essential travel and transit home as described in the recommendation, any prohibition of transport services, such as flight or train bans, should be discontinued.

explored in case of limited RT-PCR testing capacity and increased testing turn-aroundtimes where appropriate.

efforts on early detection of most infectious cases and quick self-isolation of these
individuals.

symptom onset.
