identification of positive COVID-19 cases; in the case of RT-PCR, the testing turnaround-time should be less than 24 hours and the use of rapid antigen tests could be
explored in case of limited RT-PCR testing capacity and increased testing turn-aroundtimes where appropriate.

efforts on early detection of most infectious cases and quick self-isolation of these
individuals.
 Rapid antigen tests are best used in high prevalence settings and up to five days post
symptom onset.
