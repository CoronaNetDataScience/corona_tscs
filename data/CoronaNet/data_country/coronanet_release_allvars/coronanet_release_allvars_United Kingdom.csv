With only very limited exceptions, undergraduates should initially plan to restart their studies at home and only return on campuses and term-time accommodation when notified to do so by universities. When students return to term-time accommodation, they will be offered lateral flow COVID-19 testing. All students are being asked to restrict their social interaction for a fortnight before they return to university and for the same period after they get there. College students- who largely do not move away from home to go to education- should return as planned, in line with the protection level for the are their college is in at that time.

Any student who has remained in university and other accommodation during the holiday, can continue to do so, whilst observing the relevant levels restriction. Universities and providers should also offer additional support for any students who may have to self-isolate upon their return. UPDATE: University student will be taught online throughout January and February, with the vast majority not expected back on campuses until the start of March, as part of a revised plan for their return in light of the spread on the new variant of coronavirus (COVID-19). Only very small numbers of students will be allowed back on campus in January, such as those who have remained over the winter break and whose attendance is critical and whose education cannot be delivered remotely or postponed, essential placements, or for reasons of student well-being. Where attendance is time-sensitive to the ability to graduate and cannot be delivered remotely or further postponed, very limited numbers of students may be able to return from mid-February, subject to a future review of COVID-19 conditions.

Spain will also remain on the amber list but travellers are advised to be cautious as investigations continue into a new variant originating in South America and now present in Spain.

Essential visitors include appropriate health and care staff based on resident need, for a person receiving end-of-life care, to support someone with a mental health issues such as dementia, a learning disability or autism where not being present would cause the resident to be distressed. Alternatives to in-person visiting should be explored, such as the use of telephones or video calls. 

Where families and friends are permitted to visit to be with their loved one then anyone who is showing coronavirus symptoms should not visit. The number of visitors at the bedside at any given time is limited to one person or, where social distancing throughout the visit is possible, a second additional visitor could be permitted. Visitors must agree to wear appropriate PPE and follow any isolation/quarantine rules if necessary. Contact between visitors and other residents and staff should be minimised through only visiting and leaving the room directly and social distancing. UPDATE: Updated guidance published by the Scottish Government recommends easing restrictions on visiting in a range of ways, including extending indoor visits from 30 minutes to up to four hours. Outdoor visits can be extended to include up to six visitors from no more than two households, including children and young people, for up to one hour per visit.
The new guidance also supports increased personal interaction, including hugs or hand holding, as long as strict PPE and infection prevention control measures are met. These include visitors can support personal care and daily routine activities, provided this is agreed with the care home and take places in residents' rooms, enabling contact with loved ones with regular training and supervision for visitors to put on and take off PPE and safety guidelines, family pets and therapy animals during outdoor and indoor visiting if agree with the care home and certain pre-conditions are met and gifts and residents' belongings can be brought in by visitors when agreed with the care home manager in advance.",2020-10-12,2020-10-12,,The policy’s end date is unknown or unreported,United Kingdom,GBR,GB,Provincial,1,Scotland,GB-SCT,,Restriction and Regulation of Government Services,,,"",,,,,,"","","","","","","","","","","",,Essential Government Services,,"",Yes,United Kingdom,One or more provinces within one or more countries,,Scotland,,,,All Residents (Citizen Residents + Foreign Residents),No special population targeted,,,Mandatory (Unspecified/Implied),Provincial/State Government,65.7522188962493,63.093076338129,60.2085713642991,102,https://tummgmt.eu.qualtrics.com/Q/File.php?F=F_1Lea9jHv3ocyYxj ; https://tummgmt.eu.qualtrics.com/Q/File.php?F=F_3MxI3kjawQUfRSl,NA ; https://www.gov.scot/news/care-home-visiting-restrictions-eased/,2021-03-30,2021-03-30T05:51:24Z,620443,42965,2513,201267,23910761,350.561,,,,,,35,22.9,2,0.934153020381927,-1.34019875526428,0,80,66488991,2880608472043.74,1.38567356958762,18.0125469430492,28.6890226627762,2,2,1.74730567601743,4.01379693180582,9552110
