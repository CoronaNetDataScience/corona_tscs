The quarantine period will also be shortened from seven days to only five days. Additionally, when a high-risk contact has taken place outside the classroom, and a child has to go into quarantine as a result, that child is allowed to leave quarantine to go to school. Partially vaccinated pupils or those who received their last dose more than five months ago must quarantine for seven days following a high-risk contact. However, they may leave quarantine after four days if they take a daily self-test with a negative result until day 7. A PCR test to end quarantine is no longer needed. For unvaccinated pupils, the rules remain the same: they will have to quarantine for ten days. However, they are allowed to leave quarantine after seven days if they take daily self-tests with a negative result until day 10 and strictly apply all preventive measures.

When a patient is tested, the doctor performing the test will ask the patient to record their contacts over the last few days.

From the middle of this week, patients infected with Covid-19 will be contacted by a call centre to ask who they have been in close contact with over the past few days. The form they filled out may be helpful during this call. People who have recently been in close contact with an infected person will also be called by the call centre. Their state of health will be assessed and, on that basis, they will be asked to take the necessary measures.

The infected patients’ general practitioner will already ask them whether they have been in close contact with certain people, such as people living in the same household. In this case, the general practitioner can issue a quarantine certificate for these people, even if the individuals concerned do not (yet) show symptoms and are fit for work. Individuals who have been issued with such a quarantine certificate must comply with the isolation measures. They can, however, work from home.

Under certain, strictly defined conditions this quarantine certificate may also be issued by the call centre under the responsibility of a hygiene inspector.",2020-05-04,2020-05-11,,The policy’s end date is unknown or unreported,Belgium,BEL,BE,National,0,,,,Health Monitoring,,,"",,,,,,"","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"",Yes,Belgium,"One or more countries, but not all countries",,,,,,,,,,Mandatory (Unspecified/Implied),"National Government,Ministry/Department of Health,Provincial/State Government",72.629688392336,69.1932738396756,66.0295914210194,80,https://tummgmt.eu.qualtrics.com/Q/File.php?F=F_V4qqhP0nRlTVgPf,https://www.info-coronavirus.be/en/news/inter-ministerial-conference-on-public-health/ ; https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/nl/2020/05/06/opgelet-contactopsporing-bij-coronabesmetting-gebeurt-alleen-me/,CoronaNet (original),,2021-03-01,2021-03-01T08:32:15Z,53449,8707,13697,11055,618461,53.263,,,,,,12,12.5,2,1.95645272731781,-0.318712323904037,2,75,11375158,530994736008.02,1.96419275543016,16.2469424128147,26.9980179447833,2,2,1.89149505165447,4.27383437836888,1783488

Companies - regardless of size - are obliged to organize teleworking for every function where this is possible, without exception.
For those for whom this organization is not possible, social distancing will be strictly respected. This rule applies to both the performance of the work and the transport organized by the employer. If it is impossible for companies to meet these obligations, they must close their doors.
If the authorities establish that the social distancing measures are not being complied with, the company will in the first instance be fined a heavy one; in case of non-compliance after the sanction, the company will have to close.

Companies - regardless of size - are obliged to organize teleworking for every function where this is possible, without exception.
For those for whom this organization is not possible, social distancing will be strictly respected. This rule applies to both the performance of the work and the transport organized by the employer. If it is impossible for companies to meet these obligations, they must close their doors.
If the authorities establish that the social distancing measures are not being complied with, the company will in the first instance be fined a heavy one; in case of non-compliance after the sanction, the company will have to close.

The measures set out below will enter into force at noon on Wednesday 18 March and shall be maintained until 5 April. The situation will continue to be assessed on a daily basis and further changes may be made as the situation evolves.

classes. New rules entered into force on Monday in Belgium that oblige students to wear facial masks in schools of Wallonia and Flanders regions as part of measures against the coronavirus.
Students of 5th and 6th grades in Flemish primary schools, as well as secondary school students in Wallonia, must wear facial masks during classes as of Monday after regional authorities imposed in October new rules to stem the spread of COVID-19.Flemish secondary schoolers can still attend the classes without covering their noses and mouths because the vaccination rate for the age group of 12-18 is high in the region.

 UPDATE: Flemish: Masks should also be lifted in secondary school from March, says Education Minister Monday, February 14, 2022. Primary school children will no longer have to wear face masks in class from next week.
Now that the Consultative Committee has decided to lift the obligation to wear a face mask for children under 12 years old from next week, the next step should be doing the same for those up to 18 years old.
