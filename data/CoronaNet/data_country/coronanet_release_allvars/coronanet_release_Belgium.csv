When a patient is tested, the doctor performing the test will ask the patient to record their contacts over the last few days.

From the middle of this week, patients infected with Covid-19 will be contacted by a call centre to ask who they have been in close contact with over the past few days. The form they filled out may be helpful during this call. People who have recently been in close contact with an infected person will also be called by the call centre. Their state of health will be assessed and, on that basis, they will be asked to take the necessary measures.

The infected patients’ general practitioner will already ask them whether they have been in close contact with certain people, such as people living in the same household. In this case, the general practitioner can issue a quarantine certificate for these people, even if the individuals concerned do not (yet) show symptoms and are fit for work. Individuals who have been issued with such a quarantine certificate must comply with the isolation measures. They can, however, work from home.

Under certain, strictly defined conditions this quarantine certificate may also be issued by the call centre under the responsibility of a hygiene inspector.",2020-05-04,2020-05-11,,The policy’s end date is unknown or unreported,Belgium,BEL,BE,National,0,,,,Health Monitoring,,,"",,,,,,"","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"",Yes,Belgium,"One or more countries, but not all countries",,,,,,,,,,Mandatory (Unspecified/Implied),"National Government,Ministry/Department of Health,Provincial/State Government",https://tummgmt.eu.qualtrics.com/Q/File.php?F=F_bgyrtc3g5t9KZPU,https://www.info-coronavirus.be/en/news/inter-ministerial-conference-on-public-health/ ; https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/nl/2020/05/06/opgelet-contactopsporing-bij-coronabesmetting-gebeurt-alleen-me/,CoronaNet (original),,2023-04-05,2023-04-05T20:41:06Z,53449,8707,13697,11055,618461,53.263,,,,,,12,12.5,2,1.95645272731781,-0.318712323904037,2,75,11375158,530994736008.02,1.96419275543016,16.2469424128147,26.9980179447833,2,2,1.89149505165447,4.27383437836888,1783488

It is essential to take measures aimed at ensuring the proper functioning of voluntary organizations that intervene in particular to guarantee the protection of the population and measures aimed at supporting the voluntary commitment of these people for the benefit of the population as a whole. 

a) The death of the volunteer is the subject of compensation in favor of a limited number of beneficiaries dependent on him. Health care is covered by the compulsory health care insurance. If the volunteer infected with the COVID-19 is sick without dying, carries out a professional activity and is unable to work, the loss of income will be covered by the guaranteed salary or social security due to his/her subjection as an employee, civil servant, self-employed. 

b) The compensation is of a lump-sum nature by the payment of a capital the amount of which depends on the link that existed between the deceased volunteer and the beneficiary. The amounts are set at the same level as that of victims of asbestos caused by asbestos who have died: for the partner (18,651 euros), the ex-partner who receives alimony (9,325.50 euros) and children still receiving family allowances (15,542.50 euros).

Belgium has reintroduced compulsory quarantine rules for all internationals who wish to enter the country during the year-end period from any country considered profoundly affected by the Coronavirus situation.

From December 18, all travellers will still have to fill in the Passenger Locator Form (PLF), but people coming from a red zone will also be required to go into quarantine for ten days, with a test on day seven. If the test is negative, you can leave quarantine.

All persons who spent up to 48 hours abroad were required to fill in the Passenger Locator Form (PLF), which is a form that requires persons detailed information regarding what they did while abroad. Then, based on the form, travellers received a text message informing them if they had to go under quarantine or not.

From December 18, Belgium authorities would start to examine if returning passengers are following quarantine rules upon their return.",2020-12-09,2020-12-18,,The policy’s end date is unknown or unreported,Belgium,BEL,BE,National,0,,,,Quarantine,Self-Quarantine (i.e. quarantine at home),,"",,,,,,"","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"",No,All countries,All countries,,,,,,All (Travelers + Residents),No special population targeted,,All kinds of transport,Mandatory (Unspecified/Implied),National Government,https://tummgmt.eu.qualtrics.com/Q/File.php?F=F_qyywPkSLhijIIPD,https://www.schengenvisainfo.com/news/belgium-to-reimpose-compulsory-quarantine-for-travellers-from-covid-19-high-risk-countries/,WHO EURO,EURO_1259912_1,2023-07-20,2023-07-20T21:01:21Z,621039,18455,0,42323,6578306,566.538,,,,,,12,12.5,2,1.95645272731781,-0.318712323904037,2,75,11375158,530994736008.02,1.96419275543016,16.2469424128147,26.9980179447833,2,2,1.89149505165447,4.27383437836888,1783488

Companies - regardless of size - are obliged to organize teleworking for every function where this is possible, without exception.
For those for whom this organization is not possible, social distancing will be strictly respected. This rule applies to both the performance of the work and the transport organized by the employer. If it is impossible for companies to meet these obligations, they must close their doors.
If the authorities establish that the social distancing measures are not being complied with, the company will in the first instance be fined a heavy one; in case of non-compliance after the sanction, the company will have to close.

UPDATE: In Belgium, the Federal Minister of Justice announced a series of measures on 21 March to protect prison staff and prisoners from COVID-19. No visits have been allowed since 13 March. To compensate for this, detainees receive 20 euros extra phone credit. Measures were also taken on the modalities of execution of sentences granted to detainees, namely early release, penitentiary leave and limited detention. In addition, for all interventions staff must wear a mouth mask. Work studios, however, remain open.
 
The Central Council of Penitentiary Surveillance (CCPS) called on the federal Government to urgently strengthen health and humanitarian measures in prisons on 30 March. It noted that in the overcrowded prisons, often with a lack of hygiene, it is impossible to adequately implement prevention and care measures. It therefore recommended to reduce the prison population to the maximum capacity of each facility. The CCPS also proposed several measures to improve the situation 
of detainees, such as making phone calls free of charge, and ensuring sufficient hygiene products and access to running water. UPDATE: The original policy suspended all prison visits from 13th of March 2020.

In Brussels-Capital Region, the Government reached an agreement on the conditions of visits in care homes for the elderly on 23 April. The spokesperson of the Brussels Minister of Health and Wellbeing announced in the press, however, that although the new rules are in place, visits will only be possible once everyone has been tested, and the residential care centre in question has all the means to manage the visit. Weekly, only one regular visitor per resident will be admitted, and the duration of the visit may be limited by the rest home.

classes. New rules entered into force on Monday in Belgium that oblige students to wear facial masks in schools of Wallonia and Flanders regions as part of measures against the coronavirus.
Students of 5th and 6th grades in Flemish primary schools, as well as secondary school students in Wallonia, must wear facial masks during classes as of Monday after regional authorities imposed in October new rules to stem the spread of COVID-19.Flemish secondary schoolers can still attend the classes without covering their noses and mouths because the vaccination rate for the age group of 12-18 is high in the region. 
Date: 11.08.2021
 UPDATE: 27.10.2021 Stricter rules are being implemented across a variety of sectors in Belgium to curb the rising number of infections and limit the damage as a result of this, including in schools across the country. Flemish speaking schools: Within the classroom, pupils will be given a fixed seat, and the current face mask rules, making them mandatory for pupils in the fifth and sixth grades of primary schools, will remain in place. French speaking schools: Meanwhile, the face mask obligation remains the same, meaning this will not be mandatory for nursery and primary school pupils.
