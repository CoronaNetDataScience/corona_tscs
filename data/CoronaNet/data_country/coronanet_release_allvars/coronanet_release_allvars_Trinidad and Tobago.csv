The next phase only starts if the previous one was implemented successfully. Below the whole 6 phases are outlined. However, due to the fact that there is still uncertainty regarding the fact whether the next phases are going to be implemented, this policy entry focuses on Phase 1.

Phase 1 (May 11-May 23) allows a slow opening of restaurants, food establishments, and vendors. All other health regulations (distance, mask and closure of non-essential businesses remains in place)

Phase 2 (May 24-June 6) entails a reopening of the country's whole manufacturing sector, public sector construction, and 50% capacity of public transportation will be allowed

Phase 3 (June 7-June 20) whole public service returns to work with flexible times (if possible), private sector construction may resume, capacity of public transportation may be increased to 75%

Phase 4: The reopening of malls and beaches

Phase 5: The reopening of cinemas.
