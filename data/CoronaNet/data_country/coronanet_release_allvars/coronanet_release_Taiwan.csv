UPDATE: Taiwan's CECC announced on July 26th, 2020 that travelers entering Taiwan from the Philippines need to quarantine at home or at a quarantine hotel for 14 days. 

However, due to a recent influx of imported cases from Philippines, Taiwan's CECC announced that starting August 12th, 2020, travelers entering Taiwan from the Philippines must now undergo quarantine for 14 days at a group quarantine facility upon entry into the country. Foreign nationals, with the exception of those holding an Alien Resident Certificate or a resident visa, have to pay 1500 NTD for their stay while the government will pay for Taiwanese nationals (and foreign nationals with an Alien Resident Certificate or a resident visa).",2020-07-24,2020-08-12,,The policy’s end date is unknown or unreported,Taiwan,TWN,TW,National,0,,,,Quarantine,Quarantine outside the home or government facility (i.e. quarantine in a hotel),,"",,,,,,"","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"",No,All countries,All countries,,,,,,All (Travelers + Residents),No special population targeted,Inbound,Flights,Mandatory (Unspecified/Implied),National Government,https://tummgmt.eu.qualtrics.com/Q/File.php?F=F_psBN5itt4kBJ5D3 ; https://tummgmt.eu.qualtrics.com/Q/File.php?F=F_pipjuBY6J8ULTu9,NA ; https://www.cdc.gov.tw/En/Bulletin/Detail/6wD7GYAX7z65DnMdqCSMPA?typeid=158,CoronaNet (original),,2021-06-06,2021-06-06T13:27:53Z,481,7,450,190,84010,3.521,,,,,,43,23.7,2,0.0290234871208668,0.823284327983856,0,63,23359768.4682467,835418802563.611,2.83033816827247,16.9665258044131,27.4511989960145,2,2,3.32287580074412,-0.0294150032180925,19886
