The campaign -which will last until April 30- is promoted by the Government of the Republic together with the Costa Rican Banking Association (ABC), the Federation of Savings and Credit Cooperatives (FEDEAC) and kölbi.

This campaign is a public-private alliance so that people can make their financial donation, which will be translated into basic supplies such as food and hygiene kits for vulnerable families.

The inputs will be purchased from national farmers, enterprises and businesses in each community, which will in turn allow the local economy to be reactivated.

The distribution will be in charge of the Municipal Emergency Committees and food will arrive at the beneficiaries' house to avoid crowds.

The acquisition in the secondary market by the Central Bank of titles of the Ministry of Finance does not constitute financing to the Government, since the purchase of the holdings would be made to a third party, who would be the one who receives the money for the acquisition made by the Central Bank.

Given that this instrument is an exceptional mechanism, the Central Bank restricts its participation to situations of systemic tension, and therefore limits the amount of its intervention and imposes restrictions on the type of holdings that can be acquired and their issue and placement date.
