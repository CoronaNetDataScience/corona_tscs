Modified game rules will apply, such that students will be at least one-metre apart, even for physical activities; and


Schools will continue to screen all visitors, including coaches and instructors, for flu-like symptoms such as fever and cough, and ensure that they comply with all SMMs.

CCA’s and school activities that include the following will not be permitted. 

High level of body contact, like Taekwondo sparring or Rugby scrum;
High exposure to aerosol and splatters, like playing of wind instruments or choir;

Inter-mingling of students between schools; and

We seek our laboratories’ cooperation in working closely with the TOC to achieve this. Laboratory testing is a critical enabler of the fight against COVID-19. It supports clinical diagnosis so that appropriate treatment can be provided to those who are unwell. It also enables active case finding and regular community surveillance, so that community transmissions can be ringfenced quickly to prevent the formation of large clusters.

UPDATE: Circuit breaker policy extended further 4 weeks and stricter curfew rules. UPDATE: PM Lee on 21 April 2020 announced tighter measures to the Circuit Breaker period, to further reduce the transmission of COVID-19. He also announced that the Circuit Breaker period will be extended by another 4 weeks until 1 June 2020 (inclusive). 
From now till 4 May 2020, stay at home as much as possible. Avoid going out except to buy food and daily essentials, or for urgent medical needs.

If you must go out, go alone; not in groups or as a household. These trips are not meant to be family outings.

If you need to exercise outside, exercise alone and in your immediate neighbourhood. Do not travel unnecessarily to other parts of Singapore.

If you need to accompany a senior, person with disability, or young children to complete a certain task, do so and return home quickly.

Everyone must observe the circuit breaker measures strictly, so that we can quickly break transmissions and bring down the number of cases in the community.

During this period, places of worship may remain open for essential rites (e.g. weddings and funerals) and private worship, subject to a cap of 10 persons at any one time and with the precautionary measures listed in the Annex. Much as we understand the desire of friends and acquaintances to pay their last respects and give comfort to families in their grief, we ask religious leaders to advise their followers on the need to minimise physical interactions even during funerals and wakes.
If necessary, non-congregational activities involving 10 or fewer people (e.g. religious classes, cell group meetings) may be held with the precautionary measures in the Annex. Religious leaders should advise their followers to adhere to similar measures, even if such activities are not held on the premises of the religious organisation.
The limit of 10 persons at any one time does not apply in workplace situations in places of worship where religious and administrative staff/volunteers are performing their duties (e.g. providing pastoral services, setting up live streams of religious services). However, the number of workers involved should be kept to a minimum and limited to essential duties. Those who can telecommute from home should do so. They must also adhere to the UPDATE: The Ministry of Health announces that from 3 October 2020 onwards, there will be an expansion of the current pilot for wedding receptions to allow up to 100 unique attendees (including the wedding couple, excluding vendors and service providers) in total, subject to premise capacity. Participants in a wedding can be split into multiple zones of up to 50 persons each, or split by staggered timings with up to 50 persons in each slot. There should be at least 30 minutes between slots for cleaning and disinfection of the event space. The cap for marriage solemnisations will also be increased to 100 persons [2], split across multiple zones of up to 50 persons each.
