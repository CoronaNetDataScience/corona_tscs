Customer Service Provisions – Department of Safety

    Effective immediately, the Department is waiving its requirement that citizens appear in person and have a new photograph taken through October 1, 2021. This will allow many customers with expiring credentials to renew online and not visit in person.
    Non-US citizens with Temporary driver licenses (Class XD and XID) will still need to visit in person to renew those licenses upon expiration of the current license.
     All Driver Licenses, Learner Permits, Commercial Driver Licenses, Photo Identification Licenses (ID), and Handgun Carry Permits that would expire between March 12, 2020, and May 19, 2020, will be extended for six (6) months from the original expiration date.  The Department will issue a letter of extension to the individuals affected.  Affected individuals will be required to keep the letter with them during the extension period.
    Gov. Lee has asked the federal government to delay the October 1st deadline to acquire a Real ID. That decision from the federal government is pending.

Personal Protective Equipment Procurement

Unified Command Group has made significant gains in Tennessee’s efforts to secure personal protective equipment for health care workers and critical personnel across the state. More than 18,000,000 PPE items totaling over $45 million have been acquired.

Each of Tennessee’s 95 counties has received a shipment of PPE from Unified Command, with the vast majority of supplies continuing to be delivered to rural areas with Unified Command reporting 80-90% of supplies.

Tennessee has also reached a critical threshold with the creation of face shields through 3D printing efforts at higher education institutions – 10,000 face shields have been produced thus far with more on the way.",

Administration Actions

Executive Order 23 – Requiring Tennesseans to Remain at Home

Gov. Lee will sign Executive Order 23 requiring that Tennesseans stay home unless they are carrying out essential activities as data shows an increase in citizen movement across the state.

Data from the Tennessee Department of Transportation analyzed traffic patterns for March 2020. While safer at home measures and further restrictions on businesses showed a steep drop-off in vehicle movement from March 13-29, data beginning on March 30 indicates travel is trending upwards, again.

The Administration also analyzed data from Unacast to understand cell phone mobility and determine movement trends among people. Unacast indicates the movement of Tennesseans is trending toward pre-COVID-19 levels.

The executive order remains in effect until April 14, 2020 at 11:59 p.m. Additional information is available here.",

Health Care Surge Capacity Staffing

As Tennessee builds surge capacity, one of the most important components is ensuring we have qualified health care workers in the event that COVID-19 cases overload our hospitals.

In March, Gov. Lee issued an executive order to help procure qualified medical personnel. That executive order loosens restrictions around retired medical professionals and temporarily suspsends continuing education requirements for health care workers.

Retired and furloughed health care workers are encouraged to sign up through the Department of Health portal if they are willing to serve. So far, over 800 health care personnel have engaged with us.",
