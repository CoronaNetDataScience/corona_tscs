# Introduction

Recent trends of an ongoing COVID-19 pandemic have led governments all over the world to react with varieties of policies. Among these measures are travel restrictions, closing of schools, health provision, restriction to businesses, information campaigns and mandatory quarantine. Moreover, governmentsÂ´responses have a variation of targets (residents, travelers, countries) and range in the strictness of enforcement. 

Due to the immense variation of governmental approaches that differently affect the rate of infections and the spread of the virus, policymakers, public health scholars and the broader public started to debate and compare different approaches. In order to understand varieties of undertaken policies, the reaction and interaction of states and sub-national entities, a real-time and traceable dataset of governmental policies is essential. 

The CoronaNet Research Project Database provides fine-grained, dyadic data on policy actions taken by governments across the world since the Chinese government reported the COVID-19 outbreak on December 31, 2019. The dataset presented here covers all policy actions for X number of countries up until XX XX, 2020, for a total of YY number of events.^[Our data collection efforts are still ongoing. For the most current, up to date version of the dataset, please visit http://coronanet-project.com]  

The rapid and devastating spread of the coronavirus has put in stark relief the previously invisible connections among different countries and people. Our dataset illuminates a countervailing kind of network --- it documents not only what actions governments have taken against COVID-19, but how these actions have targeted other geographical regions and the people and resources within them over time. The data, which is publicly available, will allow us to understand among other things, how the effectiveness of different government policies may vary over time or depending on policy actions taken by other governments. 

More specifically, the CoronaNet database collects data on government policy actions taken against the coronavirus across the following dimensions and tracks them over time:

+ The type of government policy implemented (e.g. quarantine, closure of schools [15 total] )
+ The level of government initiating the action (e.g. national, provincial, municipal etc.)
+ The geographical target of the policy action, if applicable (e.g. national, provincial, municipal etc.)
+ The human or material target of the policy action, if applicable (e.g. travlers, ventilators)
+ The directionality of the policy action, if applicable (e.g., inbound, outbound, both)
+ The mechanism of travel that the policy action targets, if applicable (e.g. flights, trains)
+ The compliance with the policy action (e.g. mandatory, volulntary)
+ The timing of the policy action (e.g. date announced, date implemented)

In what follows, we describe in greater detail the methodology we employed to collect this data, a description of the data, and an application of the data. This paper examines distinctive policymaking behavior and identifies patterns among states. We introduce a severity index which allows us to compare different approaches and commbines the stringency of policy types with the strictness of policy enforcements.[FINDINGS HERE] For more information on the exact variables collected, please reference the codebook in the appendix.
