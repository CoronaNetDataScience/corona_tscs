# This code transforms the raw survey qualtrics data
# for the CoronaNet Project into a long format
# the output for this code is currently saved under 'coranaNetData_clean_April+3%2C+2020_01.39.rda' in the Data/CoronaNet folder of the Dropbox

## the code should transform the data such that:
# for the initiating policy actor, there is:
# one column for the country: init_country
# one column for the initiating province, where applicable: init_province
# one column for the initiating city, where applicable: int_city
# one column for the initiating other body, where applicable: init_other_level
# for the geographical target of the policy actors, there is:
# one column for the targeted country/regional grouping  (see note below in line 336 about breaking out the countries in regional groupings): target_country_region
# one column for the targeted province, where applicable: target_province
# one column for the targeted city, where applicable: target_city
# for the type of policy, there is:
# one column for the broad type of policy: type
# one column for the sub-category of a policy: type_sub_cat
# one column for the 'other' text entries of a sub-category of a policy: type_sub_cat_other
# one column for the number of a policy (e.g. how many masks) where applicable: type_sub_num
# one column for other broad policy types: type_other
# there is one column for the who/what target of a policy: target_who_what
# there is one column for the travel mechanism of a policy: travel_mechanism
# there is one column for the compliance of a policy: compliance
# there is one column for the enforcer of a policy: enforcer
# for the timing of a policy there is
# one column for date announced: date_announced
# one column for date policy implemented: date_start
# one column for date when policy ends, if found: date_end

# note that the 'other columns' where they exist, correspond to the above, with a TEXT at the end, unless otherwise specified above

# To-do List:

# 1) Finish resolving/checking for when the 'other'/text_entry category is selected for all applicable variables
# I tried to mark where this still needs to be done with the following comments: "!!! NOTE "
# Note, for now, I've left the 'other' text entry vars as their own columns, we may want to combine some of these 'other' text entries with the main variable for some of these variables at some point
# 2) check 'notes' section and address issues there accordingly
# 3) ?organize sources (rename?)
# 4) ?relabel some of the variable names for text entry vars to make them more intuitive
# 5) at the very end, download latest version of dataset and make sure everything still works

###------ combining info on QUANTITY of policy type, where applicable----- ###

# the policies for which the 'quantity' of a policy type apply are:
# the health resources variables (type_num_health_[health resource]), the number of quarantine days (type_num_quarantine_days), and number of poeple restricted from gathering (type_num_mass_gathterings)

# what makes making it so difficult to turn the health resources data into long format in particular is that:
# some, but not all health resources have a text entry to code the number of resources (e.g. masks)
# and some, but not all text entries are filled up
# at the end of the day, you want one column with the subtype (quality) of the health resource and another column with the number (quantity) of each health resource
# but these do not overlap perfectly in the data as currently formatted

# to solve this, in the below, (A) first we make a column for the number of health policies (type_sub, and type_sub_num) ( we also throw in days quarantine and number of people restricted from meeting)
#  (B) then a column for the type of health policies (type_health_policies)
# type_sub accounts for all sub policies that have a number associated with them (e.g. number of masks, number of quarantine days); type_sub_num gives the actual numbers
# type_health_resource accounts for all policies that were selected but don't have a number associated with them (e.g. the policy was about masks but the source didn't specify how many)
# sometimes type_sub and type_health coincide, sometimes they don't
# (C) then we resolve any duplicates that arise from doing (A) and (B)
